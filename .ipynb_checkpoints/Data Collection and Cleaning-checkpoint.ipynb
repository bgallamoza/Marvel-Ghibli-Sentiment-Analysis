Mommy... My flowers died No wonder, the way you clung to them A little water when we get there and they\\'ll perk right up My very first bouquet is farewell flowers, how sad What about that rose you got for your birthday? One rose isn\\'t a bouquet You dropped your card I\\'m opening the window C\\'mon now, behave yourself It\\'s a big day for all of us SPI RITED AWAY: Hey... Did I take the wrong turn? I don\\'t get it That must be it, look It must be that blue one over there That\\'s it I must\\'ve missed the turn-off I bet this road\\'ll get us there This is always how you get us lost Just a little farther, OK?

Chihiro, you wait in the car Mommy Wait Watch your step You\\'ll make me trip, Chihiro, clinging like that Where are we? Say, do you hear that? It\\'s a train! Maybe we\\'re near the station Let\\'s go and find out What are those houses doing here? I knew it This must be an abandoned theme park They built so many in the early \\'90s, but they all went down with the economy This must be one of \\'em What! No! Let\\'s go back, Daddy C\\'mon! Mommy, that building\\'s moaning It\\'s just the wind What a lovely spot We should\\'ve brought our lunch with us They were making a river Hey, you smell that?

No, but I know it\\'s very precious I\\'m here to apologize for Haku I\\'m sorry You felt fine while you held it? What? What\\'s this? The spell is gone I\\'m sorry I stepped on that strange bug that was on the seal and squashed it Squashed it! You know, my sister snuck that bug into the dragon, so she could control her apprentice Squashed it! You sit too You\\'re No Face, aren\\'t you? You sit, too Oh, um, please turn them back into themselves Why my dears, the spell\\'s long broken You can turn yourselves back My sister and I are two halves of a whole, but we really don\\'t get along You\\'ve seen what bad taste she has Sorceress twins are just a recipe for trouble I\\'d like to help you, dear but there\\'s nothing I can do It\\'s one of our rules here You\\'ve got to take care of your parents and that dragon boyfriend of yours, on your own  But, um, can\\'t you even give me a hint? I feel like Haku and I met, a long time ago In that case, it\\'s easy Nothing that happens, is ever forgotten, even if you can\\'t remember it It\\'s already late Why don\\'t you stay the night? You boys give me a hand Keep at it That\\'s right, you\\'re terrific You\\'re a big help... A magic one won\\'t do the trick Pull it through there... And do it again I really have to go home, granny Haku could die while I\\'m just sitting here... They might eat my mom and dad! Just wait a little longer There we are Use it tie back your hair It\\'s so pretty It\\'ll protect you I made it from the thread they spun Thank you What good timing We\\'ve got another guest, let him in Sure Haku!

Thank you for everything Good bye Thank you Come and see us Haku Let\\'s go Where are Mom and Dad? They\\'ve gone on ahead There\\'s no water! I can\\'t go any farther Go back the way you came, Chihiro But don\\'t ever look back Not until you\\'re out of the tunnel What about you, Haku? I\\'ll speak to Yubaba Quit my apprenticeship I\\'m fine, now that I have my name back I\\'ll go back to my world, too Can we meet again? I\\'m sure Promise Promise Now go, and don\\'t look back Chihiro! Where have you been? Hurry up Mom! Dad! You can\\'t just run off like that Away we go Mom, are you sure you\\'re OK? What? I\\'m sure the moving van\\'s there by now Hurry along, Chihiro Watch your step You\\'ll make me trip, Chihiro clinging like that The end of the tunnel Hey... What is it? Will you look at that It\\'s all dusty inside, too Some kind of joke? You think?  I told you not to stop here OK, all clear We\\'re off, Chihiro Hurry up, Chihiro! Somewhere, a voice calls, in the depths of my heart May I always be dreaming, the dreams that move my heart So many tears, of sadness, uncountable through and through I know on the other side of them, I\\'ll find you Everytime we fall down to the ground, we look up to the blue sky above We wake to its blueness, as for the first time Though the road is long and lonely and the end far away, out of sight I can with these two arms, embrace the light As I bid farewell, my heart stops, in tenderness I feel My silent empty body begins to listen to what is real The wonder of living, the wonder of dying The wind, town and flowers, we all dance one unity Somewhere, a voice calls, in the depths of my heart Keep dreaming your dreams, don\\'t ever let them part Why speak of all your sadness or of lifes painful woes Instead let the same lips sing a gentle song for you The whispering voice, we never want to forget, in each passing memory Always there to guide you When a mirror has been broken, shattered pieces scattered on the ground Glimpses of new life, reflected all around Window of beginning, stillness, new light of the dawn Let my silent empty body be filled and reborn No need to search outside, nor sail across the sea Cause here shining inside me, it\\'s right here inside me I\\'ve found a brightness, it\\'s always with me Produced by Studio Ghibli Producer SUZUKI Toshio Written and Directed by MIYAZAKI Hayao The End '],\n",
       " 'Princess Mononoke': ['In ancient times, the land lay covered in forests, where, from ages long past, dwelt the spirits of the gods. Back then, man and beast lived in harmony, but as time went by, most of the great forests were destroyed. Those that remained were guarded by gigantic beasts... who owed their allegiance to the Great Forest Spirit, for those were the days of gods and demons. Yakul! Come on, boy. - Girls! - Ashitaka! There\\'s something strange going on. You have to hurry. The wise woman wants everybody back to the village at once. - We just came from Ji-san. - Did he see something? Yes, in the forest. Something\\'s wrong. - The birds have gone. - The animals too. I\\'ll go to the watchtower and check with Ji-san. You three hurry back home and be quick about it. All right. Be careful! Huh? Something\\'s there. - Ji-san, did you see it too? - I did. It isn\\'t human. The wise woman\\'s calling everybody back to the village. There. Look. - It\\'s some kind of demon! - A demon? Run, Yakul! Run! It\\'s headed for the village. I\\'ve got to stop it. Prince Ashitaka, wait! Be careful! That thing is cursed! Don\\'t let it touch you! Here, Yakul! Calm your fury, o mighty lord! Whatever you may be, god or demon, please leave us in peace! - The monster! - Come on! Go back! Please! Leave our village alone! Stop! Please! Stop! Get up! - Run! - Come on! Hurry! - He killed it! - Ashitaka! - Fetch the wise woman! - Don\\'t put the fire out yet. Ashitaka! Are you all right? - Kaya, don\\'t touch it. This wound is evil. - The prince has been hurt. - Where is the wise woman? - Here she comes! You must keep away from him, all of you. Everyone, stay back. - What shall we do? - Take this and pour it over his wound, child, slowly. All right. O nameless god of rage and hate, I bow before you. A mound will be raised and funeral rites performed on this ground where you have fallen. Pass on in peace and bear us no hatred. Disgusting little creatures, soon all of you will feel my hate... and suffer as I have suffered. I\\'m afraid this is very bad. The stones tell me the boar god came from far to the west. He had some kind of poison inside him, driving him mad, a poisonous hatred that consumed his heart and flesh... and turned him into a demon monster. - Prince Ashitaka? - Yes? Show everyone your right arm. What\\'s it mean? My prince, are you prepared to learn... what fate the stones have foretold you? Yes, I was prepared the very moment that I let my arrow fly. Mmm. The infection will spread throughout your whole body, bone and flesh alike. It will cause you great pain and then kill you. Is there no way we can stop it? The prince got that wound by defending our village and saving our lives! Do we just sit here and watch him die? You cannot alter your fate, my prince. However, you can rise to meet it, if you choose. Look at this. This iron ball was found in the boar\\'s body. This is what hurt him so. It shattered his bones and burned its way deep inside him. This is what turned him into a demon. There is evil at work in the land to the west, Prince Ashitaka. It\\'s your fate to go there and see what you can see with eyes unclouded by hate. You may find a way to lift the curse. - You understand? - Yes. We are the last of the Emishi. It\\'s 500 years since the Emperor destroyed our tribe... and drove the remnants of our people to the east. Some managed to survive here for all these years, but the blood of our tribe has grown thinner and weaker with each generation.   Now our last prince must cut his hair and leave us, never to return? Sometimes I think the gods are laughing at us. Our laws forbid us from watching you go, Ashitaka. Whatever comes to pass now, you are dead to us forever. Farewell. - Ashitaka! - Kaya, what are you doing here? You know it\\'s forbidden. Do you think I care about that? I came to give you this so you won\\'t forget your little sister. Your crystal dagger. Kaya, I can\\'t take this. Please, keep it with you, brother, to protect you. You must take it with you. Please, I want you to have it, so you won\\'t... forget. Kaya, you know I could never forget you. A battle? No. A massacre. Where are you going? Come back here, you coward! They\\'re unarmed! Move in! Look! Up there, on the hill! - It\\'s a warrior! - Good! His head is mine! You! Stop! - My arm! What\\'s happening to me? - Stop him! Hurry! Stop him before he gets away! Let me pass! I\\'m warning you! A demon. The mark is getting bigger. - Who\\'s that? - I\\'ve never seen him. Are you selling soup or donkey piss? Mommy! Look! There he is now. I wouldn\\'t get too close to him. - Will this be enough? - Hey! What are you trying to pull? This isn\\'t money. Give me back my rice, you little thief. - Excuse me, but might I inspect that? - Go ahead. Mmm? My God! But this is a lump of pure gold, you silly woman! However, if it\\'s money you want, I\\'ll pay for the rice and take this nugget off your hands. What do ya say? My good people, is there a money changer who could tell us how much this is worth? No? All right. Now, I\\'m just a monk, but I\\'d say three bags of rice at least. That\\'s right, maybe even more. Hey, wait a minute. Where are you going? Where are you going? Give me my gold! Hey! You can\\'t just rush off now.  We\\'ve only just met. We have got your rice, and everything\\'s fine. You\\'re a man of few words. I understand. Don\\'t you even think of thanking me. It was my pleasure. In fact, I should be thanking you, really. You see, I was caught in that battle. I saw what you did to those samurai. You fight like a demon. Where\\'d you learn to fight like that? I see you noticed we\\'re being followed. That\\'s what we get for waving that gold nugget around. They\\'ll wait till we\\'re asleep, then slit our throats. What to you say we give \\'em a little demonstration of how fast we can run, huh? So the demon monster turned out to be a giant boar. I followed its trail westward through the mountains... to where the samurai were attacking those villagers. - But then- - You lost it. That\\'s life. See this place here? When I came here last, a few years back, this was a lovely little village. But then there must have been a flood or a landslide or a fire. The only sure thing is that everybody\\'s dead. These days, there are angry ghosts all around us, dead from wars, sickness, starvation. And nobody cares. So you say you\\'re under a curse? So what? So\\'s the whole damn world. Mmm! Ahh! I was wrong to fight in that village. Two men are dead because of me. Samurai thugs. You win some,you lose some. Hand me your bowl. My point is, everybody dies. Some now, some later. From brothel girl to Emperor. I\\'ve heard them say that the Emperor has promised... an entire hill of gold to anyone who can help him live forever. Beautiful bowl. I\\'ve seen one other like it. Have you ever heard of the Emishi people? They\\'re said to ride red elks. They also use stone arrowheads just like you. Of course, they were all wiped out 500 years ago. Don\\'t worry.  I won\\'t tell anyone where you\\'re from. Anyway, I\\'ve got much bigger fish to fry. Have you ever come across anything like this before? Never have. It came from the giant boar. It was inside him. I\\'m sure it was that little ball of iron that killed him. There\\'s a place high in the mountains far to the west of here. It\\'s where the spirit of the forest dwells, and it\\'s a very dangerous place for humans. - To enter there is certain death. - The Spirit of the Forest? I\\'ve been told the beasts there are all giants, just as they were in the dawn of time. See ya there, my friend. Mmm. Hyah! Move! Hyah! Hyah! Come on! Watch the load! Push him! Hyah! Ha! The sooner we get this rice home, the sooner we eat. Let\\'s move! Coming this way! Wolves! Don\\'t let the oxen panic! Stay calm! Take up your positions! Keep your powder dry. Make sure you wait for them to come within range! - Ready! And fire! - Fire! - They\\'re getting away! - Fire! - Second round! Fire! - Fire! That was it? They weren\\'t so big. They\\'re just pups. Wait till you see their mother. Where are they? It\\'s Moro! Come on. Ha, ha! We killed her! You forget she is a god. It will take more than that. - She certainly did some damage. - We move out now. What about the men she pushed over the cliff? They\\'re dead. Let\\'s get the living home. He\\'s still breathing. Hang on. Huh? My name is Ashitaka! I have traveled far from lands to the east. Are you ancient gods, and have I come at last to the realm of the Spirit of the Forest? Go away. A kodama! I never thought I\\'d see one of them here. Oh, no, no, no, no! Easy there. You don\\'t want to make your injuries worse, do you? Oh, no! He\\'s a tree spirit. He brings good luck. It\\'s a sign this forest is healthy. But they\\'ll lead their lord  and master right to us. Who do you mean? You mean those wolves I just saw? - No, I mean a real monster, like a huge enormous deer, Except they say it\\'s got a human face sometimes, and then at night they say it- Where\\'d it go? Look! Reinforcements! We\\'re doomed! Oh, no! If Yakul\\'s not afraid, then we have nothing to worry about here. Would you be kind enough to grant us passage through your forest, little one? Sir, I really think we should turn around now. I wonder, did I mention that no humans have ever made it through these woods alive? There\\'s a lovely trail back across the river. The current\\'s too swift for us to get across, and your friend\\'s injuries are very bad. If we don\\'t get him back soon, he doesn\\'t have a chance. Hey, little fellow, are you showing us the way or just getting us more lost? Please, sir, I\\'m really pretty sure they\\'re not trying to help us get home. Oh, my God! There\\'s thousands of them. Look at that. That must be their mother, a fine old tree. Oh. This place is magical. The tracks of those wolves and the girl with them. This place must be where the four of them live. Sir, I think maybe we took a wrong turn somewhere. This is a place for gods and demons. I think we\\'re safe. We\\'ll rest a bit. More tracks? Whatever made these made them recently. Sir! What\\'s going on? Are you all right? Uh, sir, what just happened there? You went white as a sheet all of a sudden. - I warned you about this place. - Here. - Did you see anything just then? - Like what? Forget it. Hang on just a little longer. You\\'re almost home. I failed her. It\\'s gone, whatever it was. That\\'s strange. Suddenly he doesn\\'t feel heavy at all. My arm! It doesn\\'t hurt! It\\'s healed! No, it\\'s still broken.  Sir, you were right. We made it back home just like you said! It\\'s a fortress. It\\'s Lady Eboshi\\'s Irontown. We make iron here from the ore in the sand. Hey, there! Hello, it\\'s me! - Look there! - Hello! - Someone\\'s come out of the woods. - Is it the Wolf Girl? Look! It\\'s me! Kohroku, the ox driver! - It\\'s Kohroku! He\\'s alive! - Kohroku\\'s alive! - It\\'s true! Kohroku\\'s still alive! - Let\\'s go see! Quiet! Stop that noise! I\\'m trying to tally these accounts here, so shut up! - Haven\\'t you heard? Kohroku\\'s come back from the dead! - What? - There they are! - There he is! That\\'s it. - This is unbelievable. - Where are the others, Kohroku? - Yes, is my son with you? - I\\'m afraid we\\'re the only ones who made it. It\\'s never the guards that die. Stand aside. That man in the weird costume, sir? Who do you think it could be? He\\'s obviously an outsider. - Be careful. - Listen to me, everyone! This stranger saved our lives. He carried the rifleman all the way back here. You should be grateful to him. Ow! Hey, watch the arm. Sir. Hold it right there. I\\'m very grateful for you bringing these men back to us, stranger, but something doesn\\'t smell right. You got back almost as fast as we did and through the forbidden forest. On top of that, you did it with two badly injured men, - and you want me to believe that you- - Kohroku! Kohroku! - You\\'re alive! - Toki, my love! Huh? That\\'s just great! How are you gonna drive the ox now all banged up and mangled? - But, my little flower- - You scared me half to death. Don\\'t you \"little flower\" me. I wish the wolves had eaten you. Then maybe I could have found a real husband! Sweetness, can we discuss this later? Toki, save your sweet nothings for some other time. And as for you, Gonza, a fine  captain of the guard you are, always strutting and throwing your weight around once the danger\\'s over. You never do a lick of work around here. That\\'s unfair and untrue. Thanks, stranger. My husband\\'s an idiot, but I\\'m glad he\\'s safe and sound. That\\'s a relief. I was starting to think I\\'d done something wrong by bringing him back home. Say, why don\\'t you take the mask off? I bet you\\'re really handsome. Gonza? Bring the stranger to me later. I would like to thank him personally. - Kohroku. - Uh, yes? - I\\'m happy you\\'re back, and I apologize. - Uh, okay. Uh-oh, milady, you really shouldn\\'t tell him things like that. If you\\'re too nice to him, he\\'ll walk all over you. I hope you\\'ll forgive me, too, Toki. I was responsible. I should never have let it happen. Oh, that\\'s all right. Milady, if you hadn\\'t been there, the wolves would have eaten everyone, and then we\\'d all have to find ourselves new husbands. Get some rest, traveler. I will see you this evening. Oh, hey! You\\'re not handsome, you\\'re gorgeous! Pull! Here! You know, they had to fight off wolves to get this rice through. Just dish it out! There he is! - Where is he? - Over there in the back. Toki was right. He is handsome. - Yeah, not bad. - But he\\'s so young! That never stopped you before. Quiet out there! We lost some good men today. Yeah, there\\'s lots of gorgeous men in here, honey! I\\'ve seen cattle that looked better. Listen, stranger. Why don\\'t you come over to our place? You don\\'t want to stay in this stinking old barn. Look, woman! We risked our lives to bring you the rice... you\\'re all eating tonight, so watch your mouth. And who made the iron that paid for that rice, huh? Tell me that. Yeah, we\\'re pumping those bellows while you pigs are in bed.  Actually, if it\\'s not too much trouble, ladies, I would like to see where you work. - You would? - We\\'ll have to work in makeup tonight. Lend me your lipstick. - Don\\'t be a stranger. - Don\\'t forget now. We\\'ll be waiting for you. It\\'s best not to pay them any mind, you know. Lady Eboshi spoils them rotten. That\\'s why they\\'re like that. They say that happy women make a happy village. Happy? Ha! Those kind of women workin\\' here? Women like that- It\\'s a disgrace. They defile the iron. Lady Eboshi goes around buying the contract of every brothel girl she can find. Milady has a kind heart, that\\'s all. You got rice on your chin, old man. It\\'s true. Everything here has turned upside-down since she showed up. That\\'s right. She\\'s not even afraid of the gods, that woman. You should have seen the way she dealt with Nago. Am I right? - Who\\'s Nago? - \"Who\\'s Nago?\" The gigantic boar god. He used to rule this whole forest. We couldn\\'t even get near the mountains with him around. Nothing to do but sit around on our backsides for months, starin\\' at a bunch of angry boars. Mm-hmm. See, the iron in the sand under this town had all been dug out. Then we tried to get at the iron under the mountain, but Nago wasn\\'t gonna stand for that. The problem was, before we could dig for the iron, we had to clear away the forest, and that\\'s what made the boar angry. He\\'s feeling no pain. Then one day Lady Eboshi came along with her warriors and her rifles. Young man, what\\'s wrong? Is something hurting your arm? No, I was just thinking about the boar god. I was thinking how he must have died filled with hate. Forgive me for keeping you waiting, stranger. That\\'s good iron. We were running behind with tomorrow\\'s shipment.  Let\\'s have a rest. - You may tell the others. - Yes, ma\\'am. Some think you\\'re either a spy for the Wolf Girl or for Lord Asano and his samurai. There are a lot of people out there with their eyes on this iron. Why are you here, if you don\\'t mind my asking? I believe you\\'ll recognize this. It shattered the bones of a giant boar, rotted his flesh and turned him into a monster. I fought with him, and for that I was cursed with this mark on my arm, and soon it will kill me. Where is it you come from? I\\'ve never seen a red elk like that before. I have come a very long way. I can\\'t tell you more than that. Answer milady\\'s question or I\\'ll cut you in half. What do you plan to do? What exactly are you here for? To see with eyes unclouded by hate. \" Eyes unclouded\"? That explains it. Come. I\\'ll show you all my secrets. - Is that wise, milady? - Gonza, take over for me. Oh. This is my garden. None of the townspeople dare to come here. Follow me if you wish to learn my secret. Good evening. We\\'ve only just finished it, milady. It\\'s still too heavy. Perhaps if you didn\\'t hold it so delicately? Milady, if we make them any lighter, they\\'ll fall apart. I trust you to figure it out. They\\'re not for me. They\\'re for the other women here. That\\'ll be something to see. This is the latest rifle that I\\'ve asked these people to design. The ones we brought here have turned out to be too heavy. These will kill forest monsters and pierce the thickest samurai armor. You better watch out there, young man. Lady Eboshi wants to rule the world. I\\'m sorry to have to push you all so hard. - I\\'ll have wine sent down later. - Oh, that\\'ll be nice. First you steal the boar\\'s forest from him and then transform him into a demon. Now you\\'re making  even deadlier weapons! How much more hatred and pain do you think we need? Yes, I\\'m the one who shot the boar, and I\\'m sorry that you suffer. I truly am. That brainless pig. I\\'m the one he should have put a curse on, not you. No! Does that right hand of yours wish to kill me now, Ashitaka? If it would lift the curse, I\\'d let it tear you apart, but even that wouldn\\'t end the killing now, would it? No, it wouldn\\'t. It would have to kill all of us to be at peace. Milady, Osa has something to say. Forgive me, milady. You must not make light of the boy\\'s strength. Young man, like you, I know what rage feels like... and grief and helplessness. But you must not take your revenge on Lady Eboshi. She is the only one who saw us as human beings. We are lepers. The world hates and fears us, but she took us in and washed our rotting flesh and bandaged us. Osa? Life is suffering. It is hard. The world is cursed, but still, you find reasons to keep living. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m making no sense. Oh, they just keep coming back. Every night they\\'re out there planting trees, trying to turn the mountain into a forest again. Stay here. Help me kill the Forest Spirit, Ashitaka. You would do that? Kill the very heart of the forest? Without that ancient god the animals here would be nothing but dumb beasts once more. When the forest has been cleared and the wolves wiped out, this desolate place will be the richest land in the world, and Princess Mononoke will become human. Princess Mononoke? Princess of the spirits of ghouls, beasts and ancient gods. The wolf stole her soul, and now she lives to kill me. The legends say the blood of the Great Forest\\'s Spirit can heal anything. Perhaps it could cure my poor lepers. Might even be able to lift  your curse, Ashitaka. Milady! How does the action feel to you? Better? Smooth as silk, the perfect thing for ruling the world. - Ah! - It\\'s still too heavy for the girls. All right. Well, look who\\'s here. Evening. All right if I work the bellows for a while? Well, I guess so. - Excuse me. May I try it? - Huh? It\\'s okay. Might as well let him try. When you get tired, I\\'ll take over for you. Well, that won\\'t be long. Oops! Better keep that kimono shut tight, girl. I\\'m impressed, but you\\'ll never keep that pace up. - It\\'s hard work, isn\\'t it? - Mm-hmm. You bet, and our shifts are four days long. You must lead hard lives here. Yeah, I suppose. But it sure beats working a brothel in the city, huh? Here we get to eat as much as we want, and the men don\\'t bother us! Unless we want \\'em to! - No! - But you can\\'t leave tomorrow. - Can\\'t you stay a little longer? - You can stay and work here. Thank you all, but there\\'s someone I have to find out there in the forest. - She\\'s here. - Oh! The wolves are coming. It\\'s the Wolf Princess! Stop! Wait! I don\\'t want to fight you. I\\'m a friend. Here! She\\'s here! - She\\'s on the roof. - Hurry! She\\'s after Lady Eboshi! - Somebody cut her off. - She\\'s headed for the forge! Keep stoking those fires! Riflemen to the stockade. We\\'ve got her right where we want her. A weapon for every man! Everyone defends Irontown! Toki, she\\'s on the roof. Now, don\\'t get excited. Keep those bellows working. Whatever happens, we can\\'t let those fires go out. - Is she alone? - Yes. She can\\'t escape. We have her cornered. You know she means to kill you this time. We\\'ll see about that. Come on. - Get a weapon! - Move! Move! Make room for milady! Can you hear me, Princess of Beasts? If it\\'s me you want,  here I am. If you seek revenge for all the animals we\\'ve killed, well, there are two women down here whom I\\'d like you to meet. They want revenge as well for husbands killed by your wolves. Come on out, you little witch! My husband\\'s dead because of you! Huh? There she is! - It\\'s her! - There she is! Everybody out of the way! Riflemen, get ready to fire! It\\'s a trap. No! Wait! Princess of the wolf gods! Don\\'t go down there! Go back to the forest! Listen to me, please! Don\\'t throw your life away! - Shall I stop him? - Leave him be. Let him do what he likes. She\\'s down! We got her! Stay back. Cut off a wolf s head, and it still has the power to bite. What? - Take aim where she falls. - Right. Open fire. Yeah! No! Stay back! Oh! What the devil was that? Wake up. No! - Skin her! - Kill her, milady! Kill her! - Are you all right, sir? Can I help you? - I\\'m fine. Fine. Get away from me! - Begone! - Yes, sir! Huh? Traitor! You\\'re a spy for the wolves, aren\\'t you? Stay back! Oh! Halt! Step aside. - What do you think you\\'re doing, boy? - Stay your hand. The girl\\'s life is now mine. I\\'m sure she\\'ll make a lovely wife for you. There\\'s a demon inside of you. It\\'s inside both of you. Look, everyone! This is what hatred looks like. This is what it does when it catches hold of you. It\\'s eating me alive, and very soon now it will kill me! Fear and anger only make it grow faster. I\\'m getting a little bored of this curse of yours, Ashitaka. Let me just cut the damn thing off. Lady Eboshi! Someone come here and take her from me. Milady! Don\\'t worry. She\\'s just stunned. She\\'ll be all right. Lady Eboshi? As for me, I\\'m leaving, and I\\'m taking the Wolf Girl! Oh, no, you\\'re not! Nobody treats my Lady Eboshi like that!  Move and I fire! Kiyo, what are you doing? How can he still be walking? - Is she all right? - Yes, milady\\'s safe, sir. Someone bring me my gun! Riflemen to the square now, on the double! They\\'re not getting out of here alive! Toki, come here. What? What\\'s happened? Sir, I can\\'t let you pass. The gate\\'s been ordered shut. It can\\'t be opened. Turn back, please. We\\'re grateful to you for bringing those men back to us. - We don\\'t want to hurt you. - Please! I walked in through this gate this morning. Now I\\'m going to leave the same way. Don\\'t be a fool. It takes ten men to open this gate. Stop it! You\\'ll kill yourself. Huh? Out of the way! The wolves are attacking! Flint! She\\'s all right! Your princess is safe with me! Stay and I will bring her! Come on, Yakul. You have my thanks. Good luck, stranger. Stop it! Leave him! He\\'s mine! Oof. His own people shot him. He\\'s dying. Why did you stop me from killing her? Tell me while you\\'re still alive. I didn\\'t want them to kill you. That\\'s why. I\\'m not afraid to die. I\\'d do anything to get you humans out of my forest. I knew that from the first moment I saw you. And I\\'m not afraid of you! I should kill you for saving her! That woman is evil, and there\\'s no one who can stop me from killing her. No. Live. That\\'s enough! I\\'m not listening to you anymore! You\\'re beautiful. What is it, San? Want me to crunch his face off? The ape tribe. All right! What do you want here? Apes, how dare you show such disrespect to the wolf clan. This is our forest. The human- give him to us. Give us the human and go. You go before my fangs find you. - We will not go. - We will eat the human. Yes, let us eat the man creature. Are you crazy? Just what happened to  make the ape tribe change this way? Since when do apes eat the flesh of a man? If we eat the human, we will steal his strength, and we will drive the other humans away. Give us the man creature. Stop this. You know you can\\'t possess the humans\\' strength by eating them. All that\\'ll do is make you into something else, something even worse than human. We plant trees. Humans tear them up. The forest does not come back. If we kill the humans, we will save the forest. You mustn\\'t give up. We\\'ll find a way. The Forest Spirit is with us. Go on planting your trees and someday we\\'ll beat them. The Forest Spirit will not fight. We will all die. Wolf Girl does not care. She is human. Enough! I\\'ll bite your head off, you chattering ape. Stop! Wait! Come back! Leave them alone! Don\\'t worry about them. It\\'s all right. You two go on ahead now. I\\'ll stay here and deal with the human. - What about the elk? - Yes. Can we eat him? No, you may not. Go home! Come over here. Don\\'t worry. I\\'m a friend. Don\\'t be shy. I won\\'t hurt you. I need you to help me carry him. Please? You are very wise. You know better than to set foot on this island, don\\'t you? Ugh! I smell like a human. You can go wherever you want to. You\\'re free now. Finally. There he is. Come and see. Hurry. Quick, you idiots. It\\'s the Nightwalker. He\\'s the reason we\\'ve been sitting around in these stinking animal skins, you know. But sir, we can\\'t. It\\'s a sin to look at it. Ha. And you call yourself the greatest hunter in the west. Look. We\\'ve got a letter of pardon from the Emperor, forgiving us for cutting off the head of the Great Forest Spirit. The legends tell us that when day becomes night, the Forest Spirit turns into the Nightwalker, and at sunrise, it changes back.  Look! See there? It\\'s happening. - Take a look, MasterJigo. - What is it? - Over there. - Hmph. Look. There must be hundreds of them. Those boars are not from this region. They must have been traveling for months to get all the way up here. - That one\\'s Okkoto! - Can\\'t be. They say he died It\\'s him, all right. I know those old tusks. And it looks like he brought along his whole tribe. He\\'s seen us! Let\\'s get out of here! Come on, you cowards! Move! Quickly! The bullet wound\\'s gone. Yakul. The mark\\'s still there. Finally you\\'re awake. You really should thank Yakul. He hasn\\'t left your side this whole time. How\\'d you know his name\\'s Yakul? He told me, and he told me about you- about your village, your people and your forest. The Forest Spirit brought you back to life again. He wants you to live. I had the strangest dream. - There was a golden creature. - Eat this. Chew. We are here to kill the humans and save the forest. Why are there humans here, Moro? Humans are everywhere these days. Go back to your own mountain. Kill them there. The girl is San, my daughter. We will kill them here. We will save this forest. What is that other human doing here? He was shot, and then the Great Spirit healed his wound. This man is not our enemy! The Forest Spirit saved him? Saved the life of that loathsome runt? Why didn\\'t he save Nago? Is he not the guardian of the forest? Why? The Forest Spirit gives life and takes life away. Life and death are his alone, or have you boars forgotten that? You lie! You must have begged the Forest Spirit to spare his life! But you did not beg for Nago, did you? Nago was afraid to die. Now I, too, carry within my breast a poisoned human bullet. Nago fled, and the darkness took him.  I remain and contemplate my death. Mother! Please ask the Forest Spirit to save you. I have lived long enough, San. Soon the Forest Spirit will let me rest forever. All these years you defended the Forest Spirit! He must save you! You are not fooling us. Nago was beautiful and strong. He would not have run from anything. You wolves must have eaten him! Quiet! Watch what you say, you filthy pig! Gods of the mountain, please listen to me. Nago died far from here, and I was the one who killed him. He had become some kind of demon. One day he attacked our village. If you want proof, look at my hand where he touched me. I came here to beg the Forest Spirit to lift Nago\\'s curse from me. He healed the bullet wound in my side, but the demon mark remains. First it will tear my soul apart, and then it will kill me. Okkoto, finally, a boar who will listen to reason. No, Lord Okkoto, wait! Please, you mustn\\'t eat him. Ah, you are Moro\\'s human child, aren\\'t you? I have heard of you. You\\'re blind. Stand back. I will not eat him. It\\'s all right, San. My Lord Okkoto, what I said about Nago\\'s death was the truth. I believe you, and I thank you for it, young one. I am only grieved and ashamed that such a demon has come from our tribe. O mighty lord, is there a way to lift Nago\\'s curse from me? Leave this forest... for the next time we meet I will have to kill you. You cannot win against the humans. Their guns will destroy you all. Look on my tribe, Moro. We grow small, and we grow stupid. We will soon be nothing but squealing game... that the humans hunt for their meat. You\\'d risk everything on one last battle? That\\'s just what the humans want. I do not ask for the help of the wolf tribe. Even if every one of us dies,  it will be a battle the humans will never forget. The Forest Spirit. Hyah! Hyah! Come on! Keep your oxen together! Hurry! Get ready now. Little bit closer. Fire! Reload! Fire! Attack- Ready- Well, I see somebody is going to have to go play the peacemaker. Take our riflemen and hide behind the cliffs. Yes, sir. - Let\\'s go. - And stay there till I send for you. Come on! Let\\'s keep the oxen moving! We have to get back to Irontown! - There they are! - Where? Coming around the pass. The hunters are ready, sir. Excellent. Well done, my boy. Go and spread the word. We\\'ll be moving out presently. Yes, sir. Greetings,Jigo. Well, I\\'ve got the Emperor breathing down my neck, and you\\'re busy playing war with Lord Asano. And you would have nothing to do with Lord Asano being here, now, would you? Of course not. Whatever made you think that? He\\'ll call a truce if I give him half my iron. Is that right? Well, he\\'s a greedy bastard, isn\\'t he? But all the same, you might as well let him have his iron. Listen, Eboshi, the boars are gathering for battle. And you know what that means. You made me a promise. Now, once you get me the head of the Forest Spirit, then we can come back and destroy Lord Asano together, huh? Watch out, milady! There\\'s a horseman coming! Get in! Well, speak of the devil, a messenger from Lord Asano. - We have guests. Mind your manners, ladies. - Yes, ma\\'am. Welcome back, milady! Whoa! Wait! Won\\'t you even talk to the man? Lady Eboshi, mistress of Irontown! I bring a message to you from my Lord Asano. You have fought valiantly and well. Now, open your gates that we may speak with you. Hmph! We can hear you just fine from down there. Milady took this mountain away from the gods, the boars and beasts!  And now that it\\'s worth something, you want it! - Well,you won\\'t get it! - The brazen impudence! You ladies need to be taught some respect! Respect? What\\'s that? We haven\\'t had any respect since the day we were born! You want some of our iron? Here ya go! They are really something. They\\'ll fight forest gods or samurai. It doesn\\'t matter to them. They\\'re an amazing bunch, your girls. They were wasted in the brothels. Impressive for a piece of paper. Well, you know, it\\'s gotten me all the best hunters and trappers around. Remember, my dear lady, we\\'re after a god, not just a beast. Girls, come here. Yes, milady, what is it? Do you have any idea who this paper has come from? From the Emperor himself. - That\\'s nice. Who\\'s he? - Is he supposed to be important? - I\\'m serious. Who\\'s he? Should we know? - Yes! They\\'re really something. Thank you. Yes, milady. Every day that we cut trees and dig for iron, the forest and its creatures grow weaker. My way, there is no loss of life,Jigo. Listen, you owe me and I\\'ve come to collect. When you needed riflemen, I sent them, and without those riflemen, you lose Irontown. Oh, I\\'m sorry. Did that sound like a threat? Don\\'t tell me the Emperor believes... that wives\\' tale about the Great Spirit\\'s head granting immortality. I\\'m sure I don\\'t know what the Emperor believes. I\\'m just a humble monk. I\\'m just trying to get by. I keep my promises. Anyway, we have fought the boars before. They\\'re much easier to kill than Moro and her wolf cubs, So you can call out that shady bunch you\\'ve got hidden under the cliff,Jigo. So I\\'ve been found out. Oh,just one more thing, milady. Did a stranger come through here, by any chance? He\\'s a young man riding a great big red elk. Came and went.  A bad-looking bunch, if you ask me. Those men are no ordinary hunters. - They\\'re killers. - Killers? Milady, at least let some of us go with you. Yes, you can\\'t trust these men. They\\'re strangers. What if something goes wrong and we\\'re stuck here? We can\\'t help you. You said yourself we\\'re better shots than the men are. That\\'s precisely why I want you all here in Irontown. I can deal with forest gods. It\\'s humans I\\'m worried about. Once the Forest Spirit is dead, we don\\'t know what will happen. WillJigo be satisfied with the creature\\'s head... or will he be after my ironworks as well? Jigo\\'s riflemen may turn on us. If that happens, I\\'ll need every one of you here to fight them. Remember, you can\\'t trust men. Don\\'t worry about her ladyship. I\\'ll be right at her side, protecting her. - That\\'s what we\\'re afraid of. - What? Even if you were a woman, you\\'d still be an idiot! .. In the moonlight I felt your heart.. - .. Quiver like a bowstring\\'s pulse.. .. In the moon\\'s mere light.. .. You looked at me.. .. Nobody knows your heart.. .. When the sun has gone I see you.. .. Beautiful and haunting but cold.. - .. Like the blade of a knife so sharp, so sweet.. .. Nobody knows your heart.. .. All of your sorrow grief and pain.. .. Locked away in the forest of the night.. .. Your secret heart belongs to the world.. - You know, you could always jump, boy. End it all. As soon as your strength returns, the mark will spread and destroy you. It feels like I must have been asleep for weeks. I had a dream that San was by my side, nursing me. I was hoping you\\'d cry out in your sleep. Then I would have bitten your head off to silence you. It\\'s a beautiful forest. Are Okkoto and the boars on the move yet?  Yes, the boars are marching. The trees cry out as they die, but you cannot hear them. I lie here. I listen to the pain of the forest... and feel the ache of the bullet in my chest... and dream of the day when I will finally crunch that gun woman\\'s head in my jaws. Moro, why can\\'t the humans and the forest live together? Why can\\'t we stop this fighting now? The humans are gathering for the final battle. The flames of their guns will burn us all. And what happens to San? What\\'s your plan, to let her die with you? Typical. Selfish. You think like a human. San is my daughter. She is of the wolf tribe. When the forest dies, so does she. You must set her free! She\\'s not a wolf. She\\'s human! Silence, boy. How dare you speak to a god like that. I caught her human parents defiling my forest. They threw their baby at my feet as they ran away. Instead of eating her, I raised her as my own. Now, my poor, ugly, beautiful daughter is neither human nor wolf. How could you help her? I don\\'t know, but at least we might find a way to live. How? Will you join forces with San and fight the humans? No. All that would do is cause more hatred. There is nothing you can do, boy. Soon the demon mark will spread and kill you. Leave this place at sunrise. Return and I shall kill you. You\\'re feeling all right? I\\'m fine, thanks to you and the Forest Spirit. Right. Yakul, sorry if I worried you. Oh. Ah. I guess my legs are still pretty weak, huh? It\\'s so quiet. I wonder where our friends the little kodama went. Ah. I can smell the ironworks. Thanks for showing us the way! I have another favor to ask! Will you please give this to San for me? Let\\'s go. It stinks, and it burns my eyes. That\\'s what they want. They\\'re trying to kill our sense of smell.  It\\'s that damn woman again. She knows we\\'re out here. - It\\'s a trap and a stupid one. - What? They\\'re trying to lure the boars out of the forest. - No. - The humans are planning something. Then we have to find Okkoto while there\\'s still time to stop him or else they\\'ll be killed! Okkoto is too stubborn. He won\\'t listen. None of them will. They may even know it\\'s a trap. The boars are a proud race. The last one left alive will still be charging blindly forward. - Why chop the trees down? - To make them angry, which makes them stupid. Mother, I have to go. Okkoto\\'s blind. I must be his eyes. You understand? Do as you must. You know that boy wanted to share his life with you. I hate him! I hate all humans! From Ashitaka for me? Pretty. You two, stay with San. I must go to the Forest Spirit. - Right. Let\\'s go. The Moro tribe has come to fight with you. Where can I find Lord Okkoto? Good luck, my friend. Huh? It\\'s coming from Irontown. Let\\'s go! - Halt! Who goes there? - Samurai again. - Halt, I said! - Out of the way! What the devil was that thing? Don\\'t waste your arrows. He\\'s knocking them away. - He\\'s a dead man anyway. - Cease fire. Cease fire! - Toki, come and look. - It can\\'t be. - It\\'s Ashitaka. - So it\\'s not a ghost. - Ashitaka! - Toki! - Are you all right? - We\\'re all right. Lord Asano\\'s samurai thought they\\'d try and ambush us while our men were away. - Thought we\\'d just roll over. - But we showed them! - We sure did! - Where\\'s Lady Eboshi? She took every able-bodied man and went to kill the Forest Spirit. We\\'re cut off here. We can\\'t even get a message to Lady Eboshi. The Forest Spirit. That explains the explosions. Hey, sir, I\\'ve still got your bow and arrows! Aren\\'t you gonna tell him  you\\'ve got his cloak and saddle too? - Oh, I do? - Oh, you\\'re useless. Many thanks, Kohroku! I\\'ll try and bring you some help! Can you hold out? Don\\'t worry! We can always pour hot iron on them. - Bring back Lady Eboshi! - And don\\'t take too long! I missed. They\\'re bringing boats across the river! Go and get Lady Eboshi. We\\'ll hold them off as long as we can! I\\'ll be back! I promise! - We\\'ll be here! - Be careful! Get him! Stop that man! Looks like they\\'re gonna try to cut us off. Run, Yakul. You two, go that way! Burning animal flesh. Yakul! Stay back! Show me your wound. You\\'ll have to stay here. Wait for me. I\\'ll come back for you. I said, stay! We\\'re almost there, my friend. Who goes there? My orders are no outsiders permitted here. All right, but I\\'ve just come from Irontown. I have a message for Lady Eboshi. Tell me where I can find her. The Eboshi woman\\'s not here. Give me the message. I\\'ll make sure she gets it. I must speak with her. Now where is she? It\\'s really you? You\\'re still alive, lad? It looks like you men had a worse time than I did. - We\\'ve been burying our friends all day. - Oh, it was horrible, horrible. - Irontown has come under attack. - What? The women and the lepers have fallen back to the inner wall. - We haven\\'t got a lot of time. - Those samurai bastards. Asano must have just been waiting for us to leave Irontown. Now I must find Lady Eboshi. She\\'s off hunting down the Forest Spirit. Then someone\\'s got to stop her, call her back. If you\\'re all done, I want you out of here. The rest of you, keep digging! - Wait! What about Irontown? - That\\'s right! It\\'s our home! What do they expect us to do, just abandon Irontown? You heard the boy! We haven\\'t a moment to lose.  - Send a message to Lady Eboshi! - The forest is too big! No messenger would have a chance of finding her! Then send out a hunter! What else are they good for? Lady Eboshi is just being used byJigo. Tell me something. When you fought with the boars, were there any wolves with them? Did you see San, the Wolf Girl? I have no idea. It was pitch black when the animals came at us. She was there. I saw her. I was right in the front line. I saw everything, everything. - What happened? - I\\'m not sure! Everything started happening so fast. It was like a nightmare. Jigo\\'s troops put us in front as bait to lure the boars in. They didn\\'t tell us about the land mines under our feet... or the grenades coming in on top of us. Huh? Where is she? Where\\'s San? Take it easy. I\\'m trying to get you out. There\\'s a wolf over here! Hey! Hurry! Young master, what are you doing? - What\\'s going on? - No! What do you think you\\'re doing? I have got to find Lady Eboshi. This wolf s gonna help me find her. You\\'re on their side, aren\\'t you, boy? Stand aside! What\\'s more important to all of you? The head of the Forest Spirit or saving your town? Those darts are poison. That\\'s enough now! I\\'m not gonna slave any longer! Come on! Let\\'s get this thing off of him! All together now! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Look out! After you\\'ve come through the swamp, take cover by the lake until we get there. - Right! - Be careful. Those riflemen with milady belong toJigo. Here. Take these. Where I\\'m going, they won\\'t be of any use. You go with them, Yakul. Look after him! Find San! That\\'s where we\\'ll find Eboshi! Come on. Keep moving. Straight ahead. Today we finish this. - Sir. - Yes? Ah, have you spotted them? Okkoto\\'s badly wounded. He and the Wolf Girl are making their  way to the realm of the Forest Spirit. So they\\'re going to beg him for his help, are they? Keep after them, but stay out of sight or you\\'ll frighten the Forest Spirit away. Yes, sir. I understand. That was boar\\'s blood painted on his face, wasn\\'t it? Uh-huh, a little trade secret. Don\\'t want to smell human. We\\'re almost at the pool of the Forest Spirit. Just a little farther. Keep going. What was that? Lord Okkoto, something\\'s wrong. We have to keep moving. - Something\\'s out there. - What? With so much blood in the air, I can\\'t smell it. I should have known it was you! - You did this! - Because of you, the forest will die! You\\'re wrong! We\\'ve all been fighting to save it! This is the thanks you give us? - You bring bad things! - Bad things coming, neither human or animal. - What do you mean, \"neither human or animal\"? - They\\'re coming! - It\\'s the end for us! They\\'re warriors. They\\'ve come back. My warriors! They have come back to me from the land of the dead. - Forward, my warriors! - Okkoto, listen! - Forward to the pool of the Forest Spirit! - Okkoto, no, wait! No, Lord Okkoto! Your warriors haven\\'t come back to you. Those are humans wearing the skins of your warriors to hide their scent! It\\'s a trick! Don\\'t you understand? It\\'s just a human trick to get us to lead them to the Forest Spirit! Come out, Forest Spirit! If you are truly master here, give my warriors the power to slay the humans and be victorious! Stop, Lord Okkoto, please! You\\'ve got to listen! San, they\\'re all around us. Okkoto\\'s done for. Leave him! No! I won\\'t let him turn into a demon like Nago did! Tell mother that the humans are setting a trap for the Forest Spirit. She\\'ll know what to do. You\\'ll have to hurry,  or it could mean the end of all of us! Go on now. Stay back or you die! And then this whole forest will see just what you are! Ashitaka? Get back! I burn! There are flames growing inside of me. You must fight it! Don\\'t let yourself become a demon! Lord Okkoto! What is it? - Is it San? - She\\'s in danger. Let\\'s go. I\\'m on fire. No! I don\\'t want to become a demon! Please stop, Okkoto! You\\'re too slow! Get on! - A wolf. - Hey! Eboshi! You keep going! Eboshi! I have something to say! - Hold your fire! - What is it you want? Lord Asano\\'s samurai have attacked Irontown! The women are outnumbered! They can\\'t hold them off for long! Forget about the Forest Spirit! Your men are already heading back to Irontown, but they need you to lead them! What proof is there this isn\\'t a lie? Lie? Don\\'t be ridiculous! What reason do I have to lie? So it\\'s don\\'t kill the forest gods. Now you want us to kill samurai instead. No! What I want is for the humans and the forest to live in peace! - Just whose side is he on anyway? - Shouldn\\'t we go back? The women are on their own now. I\\'ve done all I can for them. They can take care of themselves. There\\'s the pool. The creature must be somewhere nearby. It\\'s the moment of truth, boys, so keep your eyes peeled. Why do we need that woman, sir? When you\\'re going to kill a god, let someone else do your dirty work. Moro, what happened to you? San! It\\'s me, Ashitaka! San! San! Ashitaka! Okkoto? Turned into a demon. Leave, boy. Fight me and the Forest Spirit will never come. Lord Okkoto, calm your fury! O mighty lord, let me have the girl! I beg of you! Please, let her go! San! Are you there? It\\'s me! Ashitaka! San! Kill him! San! Stop him! He\\'ll ruin everything! San! San!  Oh, Ashitaka! - San! - Ashitaka! And here I was saving the last of my strength... to bite off that damn woman\\'s head. But I must save San. Close ranks! Use your grenades! Don\\'t touch him. He\\'s no longer a god. You can\\'t even speak, can you? Well done, men. Now, fall back and get the wounded out of here. Go on. Ooh, what a revolting spectacle. Hmm. It\\'s him. Give me back my daughter, demon. Ashitaka, can you save the girl you love? The Forest Spirit. Eboshi! Hold your fire! Huh? Eboshi! Your enemy\\'s not the Forest Spirit. - But that should have killed it. - He\\'s a god. It\\'ll take more than one shot. San! Don\\'t die. I don\\'t get it. The Great Forest Spirit took their lives away. Huh? - Quick! He\\'s starting to change. - Now watch closely, everyone. I\\'m going to show you how to kill a god, a god of life and death. The trick is not to fear him. No! Stop! Eboshi! You will die! She did it! Quickly! Go get the head! Quick,Jigo! Bring me that box of yours! The porters are all dead! Hurry! Hurry! Be careful not to touch the spirit\\'s body! It\\'ll suck the life out of you! Here it is! One head, as promised! Watch out! Milady! I told you. A wolf s head can still bite. Come on! We got to get out of here. - Hurry! - It\\'s coming, sir! - Run! - Run! Gonza, we\\'ve got to get to the island! - Island? I can\\'t swim! - Then walk along the bottom. Give her to me! I\\'ll cut her throat! Your claim has been avenged. Your mother saw to that. Here. - Lady Eboshi. - Help me. Don\\'t waste your sympathy. Ow! - I promised Toki that I\\'d bring you back to Irontown. He\\'s searching for his head. We can\\'t stay here. San, you have got to help us. No! You\\'re on their side! You always were! Take that damn woman and just go away! San?  Never! I hate all of you humans! Yes, I\\'m human, San, and so are you. Stop it! I\\'m a wolf, you hear? - San? - Stay back! Oh. I\\'m sorry. I tried to stop it. It\\'s over. Everything\\'s over. The forest is dead. Nothing is over. The two of us are still alive. Now, will you help me, San? Hey, wait! Come back! Help us! A little crisis and they panic. Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing? This way! Look! The head is moving! It\\'s calling him to us! There you go. - It shouldn\\'t jam anymore. - Thanks. - It\\'s awfully quiet. - Asano is waiting for sunrise. I wonder if that young man ever found Lady Eboshi. Don\\'t worry about him. He found her, all right. They\\'ll be marching over that hill any minute now. Big dope. Don\\'t ask me why I love him. - Hey, Kohroku! - Let him sleep, Toki, while he can. Huh? - What\\'s that? - I don\\'t know, but I don\\'t like it. It\\'s the Nightwalker! Everybody, hold your positions! - Toki, it\\'s coming right at us. - Run! We\\'ve gotta go! No! We promised Lady Eboshi we would defend Irontown! Look! Over there! He\\'s come back! Get everyone out! The Great Spirit\\'s head\\'s been cut off, and he wants it back! If that black ooze touches you, you\\'re dead! Run for the lake! The water will slow it down! Lady Eboshi and the men are on their way from the other side. I\\'m gonna try to return his head before he kills us all. Hurry! - What are we gonna do now? - It\\'ll kill us all! - We\\'ll never get out now! - That\\'s enough! Get everyone down to the lake and stay calm. We can carry the sick and the wounded. Not that way! Stop! Oh! There it goes! We\\'re done for! Once the forge burns, that\\'s it. That\\'ll be the end of Irontown. We\\'re still alive, Kohroku. We\\'ll manage somehow. Now, let\\'s go. There they are! Go! Stop right there!  Whoa! Oh, you\\'re both alive. Oh, how nice. I\\'m giving the creature back its head. Put the box down and back away. Give the head back now? Come on, boy. Don\\'t be silly. Now, when the sun\\'s about to come up? Look! He\\'s a brainless, swollen, life-sucking god of death. At sunrise he\\'ll vanish. Sir, it\\'s coming! We\\'ve gotta get out of here! Look, everybody wants everything. That\\'s the way the world is. But I might actually get it. Don\\'t force me to kill you. Oh, dear, you make it sound so very easy. You really ought to... relax! Get going! Oh! Ashitaka! I got it! Whoa! Ooh! Everything\\'s- Oof. Under control! Oof. This is bad. Master, we\\'re surrounded! - Come on, sun! Rise! - Open the box! Don\\'t you see? It\\'s too late for that now! Why are you wasting your breath talking to him? Human hands must return it! Don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you. Forest Spirit! We give you back your head! Take it and be at peace! Uh, well, that got his attention, all right. Well, I think it\\'s over. - Hello! - It\\'s the men. The men! The men are back! I really can\\'t believe we made it. I never thought I\\'d live to see home again. - Milady! You\\'re here! - Her ladyship has been injured. Look! It\\'s falling on Irontown! Hang on tight, everybody! Don\\'t let go! Huh? I didn\\'t know the Forest Spirit made the flowers grow. San. San, look. Even if all the trees return, it won\\'t be his forest anymore. The Great Forest Spirit is dead now. Never. He\\'s life itself. He\\'s not dead, San. He\\'s here right now, trying to tell us something, that it\\'s time for us both to live. Ashitaka, you mean so much to me, but I can\\'t forgive the humans for what they\\'ve done. I understand. You\\'ll live in the forest, and I\\'ll go help them rebuild Irontown.  I\\'ll always be near. Yakul and I will come and visit you... whenever we can, all right? Amazing. The wolves and that crazy little Wolf Girl helped save us all. Ashitaka. Can someone find him? I need to thank him. We\\'re going to start all over again. This time we\\'ll build a better town. Well, I give up. You can\\'t win against fools. .. In the moonlight I felt your heart.. .. Quiver like a bowstring\\'s pulse.. .. In the moon\\'s mere light you looked at me.. .. Nobody knows your heart.. .. When the sun has gone I see you.. .. Beautiful and haunting but cold.. .. Like the blade of a knife so sharp, so sweet.. .. Nobody knows your heart.. .. All of your sorrow grief and pain.. .. Locked away in the forest of the night.. .. Your secret heart belongs to the world.. .. Of the things that sigh in the dark.. .. Or the things that cry in the dark... '],\n",

       " 'The Secret World of Arietty': ['Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Hakuhodo DYMP, Walt Disney Japan, Mitsubishi, Toho and Wild Bunch present I\\'ll never forget that summer. I spent a week in the old house where my mother grew up. Planning and Screenplay by Hayao Miyazaki Produced by Toshio Suzuki Based on \"The Borrowers\" by Mary Norton Music by Ccile Corbel Almost there. Feeling all right? Yes. Directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi KARIGURASHI NO ARRIETTY Haru... how many times have I told her? - I\\'ll be right back. - Okay. Haru! You\\'re blocking the driveway again. Sho? Where are you? Don\\'t touch! These aren\\'t for you. - Arrietty! - What? You went outside again, didn\\'t you? And you might clean up this room, young lady. It\\'s my own little garden. If you ask me, it looks like a mess. Oh! Is that a bay leaf? Oh well, I guess this means your birthday comes early. Enough for a whole year. But the bay tree\\'s so far away. If a human bean saw you... I\\'m always careful. The world is full of dangerous creatures. Your great uncle... ... was eaten by a frog. Right? Doesn\\'t that shiso smell lovely? Yes, it does. With a bit of sugar I could make shiso juice. Wait till tonight. I\\'ll borrow some for you. My first borrowing ever! I\\'ve been practicing night and day. Papa\\'s home. Welcome back. - Papa, about tonight... - There\\'s a boy in the house. I saw him. - No! Arrietty... - He didn\\'t see me! I hid behind the bay leaf. Papa, we\\'re still going, aren\\'t we? I won\\'t hear of it. It\\'s too dangerous. But he\\'s just a child! Papa, I\\'ve been waiting for such a long time. The children can be more savage than the grownups. I\\'ll be fine! Youngsters go to bed early. Thank you Papa! But Pod... The boy\\'s sick. Don\\'t worry, we\\'ll be fine. But still... Stop worrying, Mother. We\\'ll be extra careful. Arrietty will be 14 soon. Someday she\\'ll have to survive without our help. Sometimes I think we\\'re the last Borrowers in the world. Whatever you need, just ask Haru. All right. Haru, I\\'m depending on you. Yes ma\\'am. Let\\'s shut the screen. Keep the bugs out. Shouldn\\'t you wear something darker? I already decided! I hope you can borrow some tissue paper. And a bit of sugar, perhaps? We could have shiso juice and sugar for the tea. But anything\\'s just fine. We\\'ll be back soon. Please be careful. We will. Arrietty! Sorry! - Hold these for me. - Yes, Papa. Hold on tight! Arrietty? Ready? Everything\\'s so huge! The world of human beans. The sugar\\'s over there. Wait for me down there. Papa, you\\'re great! Now let\\'s get that tissue. Papa, look. Your first borrowing. Be careful, it\\'s sharp. I will! Papa, borrowing is such fun! Look down there. Rats. Steer clear of them. They\\'re trouble. I\\'m not afraid. I\\'m ready for anything. I\\'ve got this! Sometimes it\\'s best not to go looking for danger. What is this place? Human beans made it for their dolls. It\\'s just perfect for us! I\\'m sure Mother would love that dresser over there. These things aren\\'t for borrowing. If anything went missing they\\'d know right away. Oh... Don\\'t be afraid. I saw you. In the garden. It was you, wasn\\'t it? My mother told me about you. She saw little people here when she was young. Was it you that she saw? Was it? I\\'m sorry, Papa. He saw me today, out in the garden. I should\\'ve been more careful. I hope he didn\\'t frighten you. Best not tell your mother, it will only worry her. All right. You don\\'t always have to run. Observe them first, then decide. We\\'re home. Safe and sound. And...?   Things didn\\'t go well this time. This light gave out before we finished. Oh dear. We had to give up on the sugar. Don\\'t give it a thought. At least you\\'re safe and sound. Arrietty, you found something. Show your mother your first borrowing. What a pretty pin. Time for bed. Good night. She looks worn out. Shall I make some tea? Sho! Come in the house. You\\'ll catch cold out there. A cube of sugar? But whatever for? He left it by the grating. It\\'s probably the same one I dropped last night. What? What do you mean, you dropped it? Don\\'t touch it. Do you understand? It\\'s a trap. They\\'re trying to catch us! We\\'ll have to stop borrowing for a while. Maybe they already know where we are. Pod, we\\'ll have to move! This was such a lovely house. Now we\\'ll have to start all over again. Well, let\\'s see how things go. Now eat, soup\\'s getting cold. Why did it have to be sugar? Thank you Arrietty. I wanted to hang everything while the sun\\'s out. You know I love doing laundry. - I\\'m going to nap for a bit. - All right. \"You forgot something\" You came back. Wait, don\\'t go. Please leave us alone. I wanted to tell you that. I want to talk to you. Human beans are dangerous. If we\\'re seen, we have to leave. My parents said so. You have a family? I envy you. Don\\'t you have one? Yes, but I practically never see my father. Mother\\'s so busy at work, she barely has time for me. Really... My name\\'s Sho. What\\'s your name? Do you have one? Of course I have a name! It\\'s Arrietty. Arrietty... Arrietty... That\\'s pretty. Won\\'t you let me see you? Just for a moment. Just a peek. Please? What\\'s happening? Oh my gosh, it\\'s a crow! You can\\'t come in here! What got into that bird? They never behave like that. Maybe it\\'s nesting season  or something. Now I have to replace this screen. Where do we keep them? Are you all right? Maybe you should take some of your medicine. Thanks, Haru. I feel fine. The nesting season, eh? Have yourself a nice long rest now. Papa... - I told you to stay away. - I\\'m sorry. I wanted to do something to help. But he didn\\'t see me. You put your family in danger. I won\\'t say it again. Understand? Yes. We\\'d better start looking. It\\'s time. Pod... \"You forgot something\" Afternoon! Package for you. Thanks again ma\\'am. It\\'s pretty hot out there. Listen, know any good pest control companies? Pest control? Here\\'s one. \"Squeaky Klean Service.\" Squeaky Klean Service? Let me just write that down. Haying problems with mice? Maybe it\\'s mice, or maybe it\\'s something else. Between us, it\\'s little people. I\\'ve seen them myself. A crow tried to fly into your room? I hope it didn\\'t scare you. Don\\'t worry, Aunt Sadako. Haru chased it out. I was so astonished! I never saw such a huge... Excitement\\'s the worst thing in the world for his heart. He came here for peace and quiet. If anything were to happen before the operation... I know, I know. I realize his mother\\'s terribly busy at work. But to go abroad on business and leave a sick child? It must be terribly hard for you without your mother. I don\\'t mind. I suppose the divorce couldn\\'t be helped. But why can\\'t she be here, when he needs her so? Aunt Sadako, who made that little house in my room? It\\'s amazing. You mean the doll house? That doll house belongs to your mother. She left it here when she moved out. It was hers? My father had it made to order in England. It was for the little people. My father claimed he\\'d seen them. He waited for so many years. He always said that house  was a present for them. But I\\'m afraid they never showed themselves again. Not in my father\\'s lifetime, nor in mine. Young Master, did you happen to see any little people in your room? Unfortunately... no. It\\'s been in our family for four generations. If you like it, it will be yours someday. You mean it? Yes. Have you looked inside? It\\'s quite beautiful! - Haru, could you turn off the lights? - Yes\\'m. This is the living room. All the furnishings were hand made by a real furniture maker. Isn\\'t it wonderful? Here\\'s the library on the first floor. There\\'s even a bathroom. But the next room is my personal favorite. Haru, could you open that up? Let\\'s see, I think it opens this way. Everything is so detailed! Detailed and just like the real thing. That\\'s a real oven. You could use it for baking. Beautiful, just beautiful. What a pity Father\\'s dream never came true. And it\\'s been so Long... Maybe the little people are gone now. Mother, we\\'ve had these pictures three years. Don\\'t you want new ones? I love those pictures. I\\'ve always dreamed I\\'d see the real ocean someday. Besides, there\\'s no point changing them now. Papa\\'s later than usual. I hope he didn\\'t get caught in that downpour. - Papa? - That\\'s the back door. Papa! Welcome back... Twisted my leg. It\\'s lucky Spiller found me. Pod? Oh dear, you\\'re hurt! Hurry, bring him in. Does it hurt? It\\'s not broken. I\\'ll be fine in no time. I\\'ll get some cold water. Here\\'s a towel, better dry off. Who\\'s this? It\\'s not just the three of us after all. Gotta go. Wait, at least stay and have some tea. I\\'ll see to your father. Get Spiller a cup of tea. Thank you Spiller. Papa\\'s so lucky you came along. We\\'re so grateful for your help. Listen, have you seen  other Borrowers? You see, we thought we might be the only ones left. This many. Then Cousin Lupy must be okay! Can I see your bow? You use this for hunting. Give that back. It\\'s not a toy. Gotta go. Won\\'t you stay and have a bite? Got this. A cricket\\'s leg! Want some? It\\'s real good. No thanks! Take care. Thanks again. I\\'ll see him out. You were looking for a new place. I tripped and fell. Couldn\\'t move. Then Spiller came. Really... His territory reaches past the river. And he knows a few places we could live. That\\'s good I suppose. I\\'d hate to camp out. But I doubt we\\'ll find anything quite as nice as this. I\\'m glad there are still others like us. Do you have friends and family, Spiller? Family? No, just me. Well, I hope you can come again. My mother\\'s stew is the best in the world. Haru? Arrietty, your stitches need to be closer together. Pull it apart and do it again. Why do we need such a big sack anyway? I\\'m going to look in on Papa. Papa, can I come in? How\\'s your leg? I\\'ll be walking soon. Papa? Are we going to move? We were seen. We\\'ve no choice but to move. I don\\'t think every human bean is dangerous. Arrietty... Before you were born, there were two other families living in this house. One family went missing. They just disappeared. The other one moved away. They were seen by humans. No matter what happens, we\\'ve got to survive. Papa... What in heaven\\'s name! Is this an earthquake? Mother! It won\\'t open. The frame\\'s buckled. The... the wall! Homily! Homily! I always dreamed of having a kitchen like this. Gather only the things we need. We can\\'t carry all that. And Homily, take nothing from the doll house. I\\'ll make sure it\\'s safe. - Stay with your mother. - Yes Papa.  You finally came. Do you like your new kitchen? Our house is a disaster. But it doesn\\'t matter. I came to say goodbye. Can I look? You\\'re beautiful. We have to move. We were seen. Borrowers aren\\'t meant to be seen. Borrowers...? We borrow from human beans. Things we need. Things they won\\'t miss. Soap and cookies and sugar. Electricity and gas, too. Even my great-grandfather was a Borrower. No one ever saw them? Probably. It\\'s all my fault. Niya, don\\'t be like that. Be nice to her. Are there other little people like you in the house? No, it\\'s just my father and mother and me. What about in other houses? I\\'m sure there are some. I\\'ve only met one so far. Oh. Soon you\\'ll be the only one left. Every year there\\'s fewer of you, right? You\\'re a doomed species, you know. That\\'s not true! There\\'s lots more of us. Spiller said so! Spiller? He\\'s one of us. And he said there\\'s lots more. Do you know how many people there are in the world? There are 6.7 billion of us. Six point seven billion...? What about you? I don\\'t know. There\\'s probably just a few of you. Until my mom told me, I didn\\'t know little people existed. Lots of species are already extinct. I\\'ve only seen them in books, though. So many beautiful species... But the environment changed, so they died out. It\\'s sad, but that\\'s what fate has in store for your kind. Fate, you say? You\\'re the one who changed things. Now we have to move away. We have to survive. That\\'s what Papa said. So we\\'re leaving, even though it\\'s dangerous. We\\'ll make do, we always have. You don\\'t know anything about us! We\\'re not going to die out that easily! I\\'m sorry. You\\'re right. I\\'m the one who\\'s going to die. It\\'s my heart. They\\'re going to operate next week, but it\\'s probably hopeless.  Your heart...? I\\'ve always been sick. I can\\'t play like other kids. From the moment I saw you, I wanted to protect you. I can\\'t even do that. I hope you can forgive me. I didn\\'t know you were so sick. What in the world is this doing here? It\\'s the kitchen from the doll house! Found you! What\\'s wrong? My mother... I heard her voice. This really is a great kitchen. You\\'re not the only little one here, I bet. I have to go. Let me out! Help me! The ceiling\\'s tilted. Hello? Squeaky Klean Service? Can you make an urgent house call? There\\'s something small in the house. No, not mice. Not mice? I don\\'t want them killed. You need trapping services? Yes, that\\'s it. I want you to trap them. Sho! Sho! Arrietty! Mother\\'s gone! Someone took the roof off. I think a human bean got her! Momma... We\\'ll find her. It\\'s locked. Let\\'s try the room next door. Can\\'t budge it. Wait! I can fit. Amazing! No, that\\'s not it. There\\'s a dirt road. Turn in there. - Before the bridge? - No, not that one! Haru opened this. Then she must\\'ve taken Mother someplace. Are you okay? What\\'s taking them so long? Mother! Where are you? But the lock... Lock? Could I have some hot milk? Okay, wait just a minute. Thanks. I\\'m a little hungry. Are there any cookies? Mother! Mother! - Mother? - Arrietty! Here I am, Arrietty! Mother! Arrietty! There they are. They finally found the right road. Another human bean! It\\'s all right, Mother. We\\'d like to take a look around first. Take your time. Now who can this be? Haru? Haru! What\\'s going on here? It\\'s finally happened. The little people are here! Little people? That\\'s right. And what little thieves they are! It\\'s really true. They steal from all over the house. That\\'s why things  were going missing. Haru, what\\'s gotten into you? All these years I thought it was my imagination. Well, it wasn\\'t. You certainly didn\\'t need to call the exterminators. We\\'d better hurry. The house is full of them! You\\'ll believe me when you see this. This is their nest. Nest? It looks like a pile of old junk to me. What? I swear I saw it. Haru, I\\'m sending the exterminators away. Now, wait just a minute. The doll house! Young Master? May we come in for a minute? All right. You won\\'t believe this. They stole the little kitchen too. You\\'ll see, it\\'s gone. It\\'s not gone. Such a pleasure to look at. Wait, I can prove it! I have one of them in a jar. I wonder what\\'s gotten into Haru. Hmm? Fresh herbs, how lovely. Someone was making tea! It\\'s just as my father said. There are little people living here. Yes, there are. So Haru really saw them. Though she accused them of stealing. They\\'re not thieves at all! They\\'re Borrowers. I mean, I wish I could see them. I bet they\\'re here somewhere. I\\'m sure they are. Excuse me, ma\\'am! Where\\'d you like us to start? Are you all right? It got away. I had one and it got away! It\\'s not just my imagination. There are little people here! Next time I swear I\\'ll get them! How far is it to where we\\'re meeting Spiller? It\\'s just outside the forest. Then we head down river. I\\'m already worn out. I\\'ll never make it that far. Let\\'s hurry. I can\\'t do it... Better have something to eat. We\\'ll be walking till morning. What? I\\'m so sorry. It\\'s my fault we had to leave such a wonderful house. That\\'s in the past. We\\'ll make another wonderful house, the three of us together. I\\'m going outside for a bit. Don\\'t go too far, now. Niya! Niya... Just a little further. Spiller!  That\\'s everything. Now let\\'s get moving. Okay. Mother, are you all right? Arrietty! Sho! Arrietty... We\\'re leaving now. I\\'m glad I made it. Niya showed me the way. Thanks. Take care of yourself. I brought this. I hope you\\'ll accept it this time. Thank you. I have to go. When is your operation? The day after tomorrow. I\\'m going to be okay. You gave me the courage to live. For luck. Thanks. You protected me after all. Arrietty... I hope you have the best life ever. Goodbye. Arrietty, you\\'re a part of me now. I\\'ll never forget you, ever. English translation by Jim Hubbert and Rieko Izutsu-Vajirasarn A Studio Ghibli Film THE END: '],\n",

       " 'Porco Rosso': [\"Due to the threat of Fascism and world War l, A crowd ofjobless pilot Is driving their planes in the sky, Doing the thief business. The air security unit takes encircle and suppress action. Air pirates are most afraid of this movie's leading actor, Porco Rosso. Porco was once the hero in the air unit, but for unknown reason He refused to return to the unit, and make curse, He then became a fat piggy. Only his old air unit partner Gina knows How he used to be. How did Porco fight with air pirates ... Porcoros Yeah?! Porco Rosso, get going. 'Mamma Aiuto' is on the move. 'Mamma Aiuto'? I don't need a cheap job. A charter ship from Venice was attacked. They are stealing fuel from the ship. Is that it? Ah... Well... Girl students on vacation were on board. It's going to be more costly then you think. I'm going to apply part three of the contract 14 to this case. And part four, too. Stop, or I'm going to sink you! Stop! I'm going to be kidnapped, yeah! They're pirates, sea pirates! It's 'sea pirates'. It's 'air pirates'. It needs 'overhaul', huh... Are you bad guys? Yeah. Are we hostages? Yeah. You guys are called air pirates, aren't you? You know a lot. It's a skull. Neat, isn't it? Hurry up kids! I'm busy. Do you want all 15 of them? It's not nice for a girl to be left behind, don't you think. I'm late The girls were kidnapped! Bring the girls back! They went that way! No...! not that way! I know what they are thinking. Because they're poor and stingy and want to save on gasoline they will change their course to nearest island as soon as they're out of sight. Shit! Damn it! This is no good. Here we are. What the heck is this? A sightseeing plane around the islands. A pig! It's a pig! It's a pig. What a cute pig... You girls could be kidnapped here. Watch out babes! Cool! He's cool!! What a nuisance! We are flying! Let me see, let me see! Hey, kids. Don't. Shut up, shut up, please. Hey, do something, will you? That's why I asked if we wanted to take all of them. Ok, just for a little bit. Coz you are too naughty... Wow! Wonderful! Hey, look at that! It's a red plane. Where, where! He is over there, isn't he? Yes! I'm not going to let you go any further. See, he is coming. That's Porco Rosso! Hey, I can't see. I can't see. Holly cow! It stopped. We are gonna fall. Not yet! We have one more engine! Damn it. What the heck are you doing! Shoot, shoot him, shoot him down! Wow! That red plane is cool isn't it? You can't hit him, can you? You're in my way. The morse code! You loose. Listen to me. Shut up! There, he is coming! Here! Get your heads down! Where, where is he? He must be hiding. Wow. We are sinking. Let's go, let's go! Come! We are not sinking. This is a plane! Sank! Don't! It's dangerous! Stop them. They are very valuable hostages to us! Don't worry, mister. We are students at the swimming school. Oh, no. Me, too. Contact from the pig again. I'm going to allow you to take half of the gold coins. But leave the rest of the coins and the hostages, behind! If you don't, I'm going to kill you all! says the pig. But... A half of the coins!? Keep your mouth shut! Come on, Pig. Let's have the fight! You go to hell! Here we go! What?! It's broken. It's over, it's over. Bye bye, play with us again, will you? Bye bye. Everything is fine, isn't it? Since we have enough money for repairs You, idiot. Be greedy! Calm down, calm down, will you. Don't touch that, it will get broken. Don't go close to the propeller.   Uhm? Pee? Do it around there, will you? Mamma Aiuto's guys said they couldn't come to see us. Shit! Such a pig became a hero... but, the young fella is an American, isn't he? If he is, that's a shame for the pilots of the Adriatic. Oh, not at all. His grandmother is quarter ltalian. Anyway, we should do something about the Porco. We have a great deal of trouble. But, 10%/! That's not fair. Here he comes. He sucks. He is a fake. Shhh... Mr. Porco Rosso! I'm a reporter for the Neptune newspaper, you did anther great job, again. I think 'Mamma Aiuto' is not going to appear again for a while. About your estimated bounty this year, people said the amount must be over that of the last year... Ouch! ... Wait. Let go of me. Listen to a song in silence. She is a wonderful lady. Madam Gina of the hotel Adriano is very famous among the pilots through out this country. During her song, even air pirates and bounty hunters become good guys. Is that plane up front yours? Yeah, it's a plane of the rattle snake, bringing me fame and fortune. The plane beat an ltalian at the Schneider cup, twice. Not only is it fast, but it is also and excellent fighter. I heard that a small pig named Porco Rosso is famous around here. If you make a deal with the air pirates, watch your tail 'cowboy'. They are misers and are poor, too. They stink, for they don't take a shower. Uh... I know that. What! Come on, you little chicken shit! What! What's going on tonight? You're up to no good, aren't you? He, he, he, he, yes mam. I'm glad you came, but don't play war games. We know, Gina. We don't work within 50km from this establishment. We are getting along with even that pig. You're good boys. See you later. Whaa, whaa, what are you doing!  Hi, Porco, tell me your story. Next time two of us are alone. That Mr. America is funny. As soon as he sees me... Will you marry me? So I told him: I married three pilots, first died in the war, the second died in Atlantic Ocean, and the last one died in Asia.. You got the news? I got it today. It's says the remains were found in the forest of Bengal. I have been waiting for three years. My tears dried up long ago. Good guys always die. For my friend. Marco, thank you for staying with me all these years. You are the best friend. The only thing I don't like is that you don't want to take that picture off. Don't break it, you promised me. That's only left picture of Marco as a human How can we break your curse? That American is very talented... I envy you. I wish I would make money like you. This is the payment for this month. You've payed off the entire loan for the airplane. Let's see, how about buying some patriots bond in devotion to our country? I'll let the humans do that. Welcome, Mr. Porco Rosso. This is ready. Give me 60 rounds of ammo as well. O.K. This country is busy, isn't it? Oh, yeah. The government is probably going to change? If so, people like you will be outlaws. Country and law don't mean anything to a pig. You're right, Mr. So goes for a mole. Is it ok like usual? We have a new supply of an incendiary bomb. Hey, kid. I'm not going to war. See you. Welcome... Excuse me, boss. Could you tell me the difference between a soldier and a bounty hunter? Uhm... You're a scum if you can't win in war. You're useless and stupid if you can't make a fortune. I've never heard of an air pirate who was deeply in debt. We had nothing to barter with, Captain. We couldn't even pay for paint. There's ships up ahead!  Why do I have to stay with such pathetic looking group? It's due to the pig, the crimson pig. What? Guys of 'Aiuto', they don't even have money for paint. Poor looking boys. Well, we are finally complete. Hey, is Mr. America around? Yes, he is in the sun. Juts like we told. I sighted the target! It's the Queen of Mediterranean! Are we going to take on such a big ship? That's why we prepared well. Don't be afraid! My engine is in trouble. I'm going to back you up. You go first. You are cunning! Do as we agreed! We share cost of repairs and expenses when we loose, don't we? You, stingy... Of course we share them! we need to share the bullets too? Altak is the only right candidate to speak out here! We've just discussed this issue. You cunning bitch! If we can't share that, I will quit... Shut up! Calm down! Attention please, attention please. Air pirates are attacking this ship, but there is nothing to worry about. This ship has excellent fighters. Let me introduce them. No. 1 is the black stallion, signore Bulkar, and No.2 is the seawolf, Visconti. I didn't know they had fighter protection. How can it be? It's totally a mess. Come in this way. It's Curtis Pass it to me! This engine finally had it. Well, Iooks like I'll have to take it to Milan. ... they were shot down, but they succeeded in escaping by parachute. The air pirates, who took all the money and gold away from the ship, Ieft the following message, 'You are next, pig! Come get it, pig!'. I repeat, 'You are next,pig. Come get it, pig.' This crime... You guys are special kind of trash. I'm sorry, but I'm going on vacation. White sheets, beautiful ladies... Don't give out on me yet, Mr. Engine. I don't like this weather. Well, guess I'll have  to go under the clouds. Oh, good boy, hang in there. Yes, you are a good boy, engine. Rosso! Fight me man to man. I don't have time to play with you. Don't run away, or I'm going to tell everybody about it. See you later, Mr. America, ha ha ha... Shit, I'm out of the clouds. Jesus. Gotcha! No, you didn't. It's broken. I did it! Now, I'm a celebrity. They are not going to believe me if I don't bring back any proof. Let's see... Yes! This cheap, crimson colored piece. This is it. This will be a nice gift for my mom in Alabama. Please hurry up. Madam, madam. Telephone, please. He is alive after all. Please get the phone at the front desk. Marco, is this you? Did you get hurt? I was about to leave to pick you up. Ok, that's fine. I lost some weight, because I was stranded on a desert island. I'm going to Milan to repair my plane. If that Mr. America stops by your hotel, tell him this, please, See you again next time. What? You think of me as a bulletin board or something?! However I'm worried about you guys, pilots like you regard women as nails in a landing pier or something insignificant. Marco, you're going to end up as roast pork someday. I'd hate to witness such a miserable funeral. A pig who doesn't fly is just an ordinary pig. Marco, you fool! Bright red broken wing. I guess you would come tonight. I come to disturb you again! You lost too much this time. Why don't you just build another one? I want to keep this one. I know how you feel. Step aside, please. I need drive into the factory. Who is that cute girl? My granddaughter, who was living in America. Alright, alright, alright. Nice plane. It's neat grandpa. Good design. There is almost no workers to do the job like this these days. She doesn't resemble you.  Is she really your granddaughter? Don't touch her! Fio, I leave this to you. Ok. I'll do it. The opponent is Curtis. I need 15 knots more. Curtis? I've hear of him. See this. This is a Hallvolley, isn't it. Don't ask how I got this. An ltalian plane which had this engine lost a race with Curtis at Schneider's cup in 1927. But it lost due to poor engineering, not this engine. This is exciting. Don't tune it up too delicately. My plane is not for such racing. An Asian proverb calls this Preaching a sermon to buddha.. Did you know that? Are you going to take all of my money? These days, rolls of bills aren't worth a damn. Give me money in your pocket, for propeller and paint and ... This is for living expenses, such as hotel and meals. You can stay here. I'm not going to charge you much. Meals included. I don't see your sons. Are they alright? All three left looking for works. Then... who is going to design my plane? Fio is. Fio! That's a girl I saw, isn't she. She is young, but she's got something my sons lack. Hey, old man. We've known each other for long time, but I'll look for another repairman this time. Wait. You are nervous because I'm a woman, aren't you? Or, I'm too young to do it? Both, Miss. Ok. I agree with you. Well, can you tell me the first priority of being a good pilot? Experience? No, inspiration, I think. Oh, I'm glad you didn't say experience. Anyway, I heard from grandpa that you flew at an early age. And have been an excellent pilot since then. That was 1910, when I was 17. I can't quit being a woman, but let me do the job, will you? If I can't do it well, don't pay me. Is it ok, grandpa? She is my granddaughter, she'll do well. In my case, I was able to fix engines at the age of 12.  Could you sleep here tonight? I'll make your bed tomorrow. The breakfast is at 7:00am. You can take a hot shower. I've you left a towel already. Have a good night. You don't have enough money. We know each other well, so will make the rest a loan. Good-morning. Did you sleep well? Did you stay up all night? This is the rough plan. What do you think? I want to redesign this wing section, leaving the plane shape as it is. This will make your plane fly faster. I'm surprised at the original plan. The wing was also made of wood. This plane is great. The designer who designed this wing must have know the wood very well. I'm really impressed. This is the only plane of its kind made, nobody used it, just put in the store room. No wonder! I'm surprised that this radical design allows you to take off from water surface. Only take offs and landings give me some difficulty. It behaves strange during the flight. At 0.5 degrees to the angle of the wings, right? Everything should be fine then. You'll let me continue with this, won't you? Thank you, Mr.! I'll do my best! But let me tell you something, Miss. Don't stay up all night. Insomnia prevents you from doing an excellent job. And it is not good for your beauty. Thank you for your advice. Well, to be honest, I couldn't sleep well last night. I was worried that you won't let me do this job. Well, I'm very sleepy now. I'll make a coffee for you. Is she going to build this plane alone? Next is my niece, Monica. She is will be in charge of general construction. Nice to meet you. This is a wife of my nephew, Silvana. She is going to do finishing construction. These are daughters of my relatives. Sophia, Laura, Constance, Valentina. This is Fio's elder sister, Giliora.  Oh, you're looking for me? This is Sandra, my cousin. You look so pretty Marietta. Wives of my sons, Maria, Tina, Anna, and her younger sister Birreta. Angelino! Grandma! Are you still alive? You've grown up to be a nice boy! Are you ladies going to work? Yes, I'd like to have some money for my great-grandchildren. There are no man here, right? Ah... All these are your relatives? Yes, they don't have any jobs these days. All the men went to other places to work. Because of the 'Great Depression'? Don't worry. Girls are nice, they work very well and are also gutsy. Making an airplane is in no way like baking a cake, I think... Dear God. You gave my company, which was about to go bankrupt, a piece of bread and a job. Please forgive us, who make a fighter plane with ladies. Amen. Well, let's eat well and work hard! Sounds good! This engine is quite something! What do you say, it's nice, isn't it? Don't over do it or this factory will be gone. Huh, you think Curtis is not worth it? Uh-hm, sure, this is a good idea. So, let me do it. But, this is going to cost a fortune. I got a lot of bills already. I'm not sure what sponsor thinks. Porco... Ok, ok. Don't look at me like that. Do it your way. Yes! I've already talked to manufacturers. I will order these immediately. Porco, I love you! Wait at least three months, will you? I want to change my job and become an air pirate. She is a nice girl, isn't she. Don't touch her. If I would be henpecked, I could not feel happy. You're a major, ah. You rose in the world, Fierrali. You, fool. Why did you come back? I make it a rule to go wherever I want to. The government is not going to let you go this time. Did somebody follow you? I gave them the slip. A warrant for your arrest  is going to be issued. Hey, this is no time to laugh. They say they will confiscate your plane. This movie is crap, don't you think. Hey, Marco, come back to the air force. I would make a room for you. I'd rather be a pig then a fascist. The era of sky adventures has gone. The only thing left for us to do is to fly for such ridiculous reasons as the country or the nation. You are a pig after all, huh? Thanks for your advice, Fierrali. Give my regards to the others. This is a nice film, don't you think. Watch your tail cowboy. They don't sue a pigs, but... Goodbye, my comrade. Porco, need a ride? Hey, you're a life saver. I borrowed this because I need to take your plane to the lake tomorrow. It's for a test flight, right? I don't need the test flight. I need to fly as soon as possible. Don't be such a fool. I'm not going to give you the plane without testing it. Besides, it will take almost a day to take it apart and transport it to the lake. We don't have much time. Take a look back, will you, slowly. That's the fascists secret police. They were following you, Fio. Me? Why? For what? Because I gave them the slip. And, because you are working on my plane. Porco, are you really a spy? Ha, ha, ha, ha! l? A spy? Ha, ha, ha, ha. Look, a secret agent works much harder then l. But, you were a hero at the time of war. This is strange if you didn't do anything... I think so, too. This is not right way! Looks like your used to being in big trouble. Well, we will be very busy. You can fly anytime you want. Two guys are hiding in the backyard, and three in the front. This excites me! Hey, don't ramble. See you later. Take care of yourself. Fio! What are you doing? I'm going, too. Wait for five minutes, please! I want to prepare my seat.  Give me a break! Do you understand what you are saying! Shh... Don't talk so loud. Fio. Look. You are a daughter of a decent man. Besides, you are not married yet. Would you hold this for a moment? Thank you. I made this in a hurry, look! This really fits. Would you hold that? Hey, Miss. I'm a wanted bounty hunter by the government. I'm not going to be playing with this plane. I'm sorry, but I have responsibility for this plane. But, I'm going to take off from the canal in the back. And I'm not even sure if I can fly without any problems. And, when you're going to fight Curtis you'll need me as an excellent engineer. Hey, I'm a man, you know. We are going to be camping alone on a deserted island. I don't care, I like camping very much. I'm not talking about THAT. Take her with you. I want you to win and pay the debt. You've got to beat Curtis My company may go bankrupt if you don't pay it. Are you really this girl's grandfather? You don't have to pay her any money. I'm going to install this phone for you two. You really want her to be wanted by the police. No. I'm going to be Porco's hostage. That way they can excuse their cooperation with you. So, please, take me with you. Take off the machine gun on the right side. What? There's almost no space even if you got a small butt. Take off one machine gun! Whoa! Thanks! My butt is bigger then it looks. It will be just a minute for me to take the gun off. I want to take off as soon as possible. If I don't do it, looks like the old ladies are gonna say they want to come with me as well. Grandma, hurry, hurry. Fio. You don't have get me a souvenir. Contact. Open the door! Let it go! Give me money! How is the steering, Porco? This is kind of like a tomboy,  just like you. Stop the plane at once! We need to make adjustments! We don't have the time to do it. Just do your job! It's wet with water. There a ship up ahead! Let's fly! Easy, easy, tomboy! The turning wing is shifting to the right. Use the tab! The tab? The one I put in anew! Hurry! Good. It became a nice boy all of a sudden. Beautiful. How beautiful the world is!? Is he following us? No. He is not attacking. That's a parade plane of the ltalian Air Force. Looks like it's Fierrali... Do you know him? The Air Force lies in wait up ahead. He says he'll tell us how to escape them. He also says that we should fly low to the Adriatic Sea. Thanks, comrade! Thank you! He said, Don't cast pearls before a swine, Iooking at you, Fio. You are so beautiful. You look like a rose blooming in a secret flower garden. You, bastard! This is private garden. I really want you to look at this. Oh, this is from Hollywood. About the production of the scenario and casting you sent, we are in the middle of preliminary trials The title is A bouquet of the Adriatic Sea. That's nice. Really? That means O.K., doesn't it? Gina, come to Hollywood with me. I was air pirates' guardsman to obtain a fame and fortune. Next I want to be a Hollywood star. And, then? The President! I'm serious. I promise to make you the first lady. Gina. I like your for such stupidity. Really? But I say no, because I already have a gamble going. When I'm in this garden, if he comes over here, I will love him. But he comes only to the restaurant at night. And never emerges in the daylight. That guy is coming back. Fool... He left without getting off the plane. I lost the gamble again. You're kidding! The gamble is about that guy? Is that a problem?  Life is more complicated here than in your country. Here I can fall in love anytime I want. Kid, go to Hollywood by yourself, OK? Kid... I hit my head because you did an acrobatic maneuver all of a sudden. I just said hello to my friend. To Gina of the hotel Adriano? She wore a white dress and was at the terrace of the hotel, wasn't she? My grandpa told me that all pilots of the Adriatic Sea fall in love with Gina You speculate a lot. So, how is the lady? You fell in love with her too, didn't you? We are going down refuel. Close your mouth, or you'll bite your tongue. Wa! Wait! Uwaa... A girl on a fighter? Where's Porco? He is talking with my dad. Not only the temporary government but guys in the King's faction have tried to get along with the air pirates. Here you are. Thanks. No thanks for such a bad news... You'd better present yourself to either side. They will pay a fortune for your skill. You got a cigarette? Curtis is will go back to America sooner or later. It's us who should to go to America. Goodbye to freedom in the Adriatic Sea. Is it Byron's? No, it's mine. See you later. Porco, this is bad news. The gas price is three times as much as in ltaly. Don't be like a businessman, make it cheaper. This gas is genuine. That's why I hate women. Hey, Mr. Would you tell her... Pay him, Fio. After that, put your big butt and your looks in the space between the machine guns. We're going to fly to my home. I'll add the gas bill to the other bills. Nobody can live alone. We rely on each other. Nobody lives around here, even though the landscape is beautiful. Here we are. That island is my home. It's a wonderful place. An excellent co-ordinator. Ohh... my butt is stiff from the long flight. The pig...  Don't move! They stinks, again... Boss, we caught him! Boss! Shit! Don't step on me... Back off! I was waiting for you, pig! I knew you'd coming here. You gave us a lot of trouble. It's a girl. The pig is with a girl. She is pretty... Shut up! What's about a girl? About a half of the worlds population are women! Hey, that girl is not an ordinary one. She is a chief engineer at the Piccolo company. But, she is very young and pretty. That girl? She made my plane much better then before. She may be young, but she's really something. Is that true? You are good with airplanes in general. Be polite, boys. She came with me to collect my debts. You are deeply in debt after all. It serves you right! Damage? Are you going to break the plane I made? Are you going to break such beautiful airplane with axes? Miss, there is a complicated reason behind this... You are going to break, aren't you? But, what I want to say is... Are you guys really fighter pilots? Would you back off? My shoes. I have grown up with a lot of stories about the pilots since I was a small child. My grandpa always told me that no one is as nice as the pilots. It's because sea and sky purify their hearts. Hence, the pilots are much braver then the sailors, and more proud then the ordinary pilots Don't tell me. I know that. What they want the most, he said, is neither money nor women, but honor. Yes, you're right! A toast to the pilots! She's really something. I understand. I'll give up on breaking the plane, you made, with axes. But we'll be mortified if we don't do anything. Let's lynch the pig! Lynch the pig! What the hell you talking about! You guys don't understand anything. I asked whether you feel ashamed or not. Aren't you ashamed of being helped by Curtis,  the American? If your mother heard of that, she would cry, and don't even take a shower. Porco came back to fight against Curtis, for pride and honor of the pilots of the Adriatic. You guys are lowest of the low! I told you not to hire Curtis, eh! Just like a girl. Don't try to excuse yourself. Boss, what are we supposed to do? She convinced us. How about asking Curtis to fight the pig? Do we ask him to fight the PIG, again? The contract is already over. I'm ashamed of it... That's Curtis! I got it. I'm not going to run away! You made your passage through there? Hey, hold this. You want a return match, don't you. But I won once, already. Besides, I am not a bounty hunter for these guys. What's your proposition? Beautiful! Will you marry me if I win? I'm serious. O.K. Instead, if Porco wins, you pay these bills. Wait, Fio! You back off! Miss, you still have time to think about that. Ask him, not me. This is very expensive. It's very cheap. Are you going to fight or not? I'm willing to fight for love. O.K. Listen up everybody. I'm really impressed with Miss Fio's decision. We, 'Mamma Aiuto', are going to back up this fight up! Yes... Let the air pirates union do this, too! Yes... Miss Fio! See you soon! This sucks! Hey pig, don't run away! Shut up, get lost! Bye-bye! This is ridiculous. Well, you are..... Don't tell me. I know, I am foolish. Fio, I think I have to say thank you. You gave me a chance to fight Curtis. Thanks. We share the same luck. We are partners, aren't we? We are going to have a hard time. I trust you. Trust me, eh? I haven't heard that in a long time, but I'm glad you said that. What's wrong? You feel sick? Fio? I'm fine. It's just that my heart is pounding.  To be honest, I was really scared. Hey? I want to swim. Porco! I made a mistake! Are you O.K? I should have padded the deal. We have a bad bargain. HA,HA,HA,HA. You're right. HA,HA,HA,HA. Porco.... Hmm? You can't sleep, can you? Now, I just saw... It may have been a dream... Every thing is all right. It's too early in the morning to get up. Porco. Why did you become a pig? I don't know. I know a lot about Captain Marco Pabatto. My father used to be in the same unit. I've heard many a story, in which the captain saved lives of enemy pilots, I liked it. Porco! How about if I kiss you? You know a fairy tale where a princess takes off a curse on a prince, who was changed to a frog. You, silly. Save it for your man! Won't my kiss work? Huh, you are a nice girl. You make me feel comfortable and make me wish to be a human being again. Be a nice girl and go to sleep. Tell me your story and I will. My story? Well... It was the last summer of the war. We were fly over the Adriatic Sea on our usual patrol. Belneldi was flying on my right side. He was an old friend of mine. He got married just two days before. I was the matchmaker. He didn't have enough leave to be with his wife for long. So, he returned to duty. Everyone was falling down like flies, whether a friend or a foe. I was chased by three planes, and had no time to worry about my friend. At the end I was the only one remaining of my unit. But, they never gave up chasing me. I made desperate efforts to run away. My hands and feet went numb, and I grew dizzy. I thought I was going to die. It was at that time that I saw the white sky. White? Yeah, it was like a flash. Because of the brightness, it took me a while to realize that I was in a cloud. I was worn out, and  didn't have any power left to control my plane. In spite of that my plane continued to fly. A cloud of planes... Yeah, it was calm, and the sky was very clear, too clear. There was a line of clouds far above me. Belneldi, you are alive, aren't you! Belneldi, wait, where are you going! Belneldi, don't go! Are you going to leave Gina alone?! I'll go instead of you! When I recovered my senses, I was flying over the sea, almost touching it, alone. God said it wasn't your time yet, didn't he? In my mind I thought he might let me fly like that forever. That would not have been right, because your are a good guy! Good guys are all dead already. Besides, there might have been Hell inside that cloud. Well, my story is over. Go to sleep. Shit, they gave me crap... I'm glad you came back to live because I like you. Good-night! Hey, hey, which one's gonna win, a pig or... you need ice-cream, telescope? Fools. They make our fight into a festival. Are they all air pirates? Trash of the Mediterranean Sea... Gangs, pirates, smugglers, spies and even some ordinary people. Heh, this makes my fame rise more and more... Ten minutes till start, ten minutes till start! This is the fight between Porco Rosso and Donald Curtis! There are no special rules, but an unfair fight will a disgrace to their fans. Shut up and start right now. Back off! You shut up, or I kill you! He'd be better off throwing a 10ton bomb... This is the fight which will determine the future of Miss Fio Piccolo. Shut up! Do you understand? If you do, clap your hands. CLAP! Shut up, that's the routine. Well, both of you present your bids. Have a seat. Thank you. Put it on the chair properly! None of you have anything to say, do you. Well shake hands or something before you start!  No way. I'm fond of cleanliness. He's hard to please. Fio, as soon as this fight is over, we will go to the church. Don't worry. My mom told me your going to like me soon. You... May I take a picture with you? I took a shower already. Everybody, smile! SMILE! If the flight is over in 3 minutes, the black plane has the advantage... This is great. I want them to do this event every month They are so cool... Curtis took over! This is going to be a one-sided fight. Give me that. Porco, what are you doing! Fly over! He would be shot if the took off now. It's very difficult for Curtis to shoot Porco in this situation. I know you want me to waste the bullet's. I know it. Looping! The pig took Curtis' back! Looping? His skill made the pig an ace of the Adriatic Sea. Shit! He's gonna shoot! He doesn't open fire. Is his machine-gun broken!? I got it, I got it! The pig won't shoot until the end. The pig doesn't kill anybody. Now, the American should be fine. You got it! Go and shoot! Oh, he didn't shoot yet.... See, I told you... If the pig opened fire, it would kill the American, so, it's going to hit Curtis' engine a few bullets after Curtis gets tired. He said this is not war, but... Porco... Are you teasing me or what? Come on! Is your gun broken, huh! You, poor bastard! They are coming this way! Come on, pig! Go away from here and fight over there! Great! The pig is leaving a cloud trail. Come on! Shoot that side! It's cool! It's the first time I saw the plance leaving a cloud trail! I've never seen such an air fight before. I'm really impressed. I ready for the flight. She'd better hurry, or the fight will be over. She's in her room, and doesn't come out. Does she want to go or not? I want to see that fight...  To G of Heart, for the pig. The air force found out about the fight. Stop the silly fight. Oh, this is must be from Fierrali. I should hurry. First of all, both of them are very tough. The show isn't over! Porco, fight! I'm not going to give Fio to a man Iike you. O.K. The pig took Curtis' tail. It's over! This is the finish. Whoops... Jammed, too. You, idiot! You are out of ammo! Whoops. This is broken because of Fio's butt... I'm not going to finish this fight with a draw. Ha, ha, ha, ha. This is not a western. You can't hit me. You... You really think it will reach here? You, stinking pig! Can't throw it! Bastard! Throw it finally! For love! Shut up! You piggy! Looks like something is wrong. Ah... they are coming. They are coming back! Wait! Bids don't leave from here. O.K. Wait, you guys. You, fat pig! You, chicken cowboy! Come on with your bare hands! Go back to cows! Porco, hold on! Stand up, pig. Go, go! Bets still stand! Where's the betting table? Can't you fly faster, much faster? It's impossible. Engine would blow. Pilots are all stupid, aren't they... Hey, Fio. Did you see my punch? I'm gonna take him down next round. I'll take you down this time. Porco, hang on! I'll make prosciutto out of you! Take aim! Come on, you chicken! You are the chicken! You seduce all women around you. That was my word. Choose Gina or Fio, either one! What? Don't choose both. Gina is... Don't say, Gina, Gina... Gina loves you, pig. She is... waiting for you... at the garden! Porco! The sound of drum. It's over! Look at that! I can see it. The ltalian Air Force hasn't arrived, yet. You are unfair... You're a dirty liar. Don't you understand, you idiot. I am not telling a lie... I don't give Fio to you.  That's Gina's plane. It's an emergency signal. The winner is the one who stand up first. Everybody, let me through. Marco, Marco, can you hear me? Do you want another girl to be unhappy? Porco! Porco! Porco, thank you! Well... This party is over. The Air Force will be here soon. Everybody run away quickly, please. Then stop by my restaurant. I will serve you all. Everybody, let's go! It's over, Mr. Hey, boss, hurry up! Shut up! I don't like the pig, but I like you. Goodbye! Thank you. Take a shower sometimes, will you? Thank you, too, Mr. Curtis. Next time I'll propose you formally, not as a bet. O.K. But I've made up my mind already. You, get on Gina's plane. No! No! I'm going on Porco's plane. You said I'm your partner, didn't you. Gina. Take her home, please. You always do this. I'm sorry. Please leave. Let's go. The ltalian Air Force is finally coming. Do you want to help me? I'm going to lead them astray. Wait, the face! Let me see your face! Your plane is over there, eh? Let me see it a little bit! After the flight from the Air Force, I returned to Milan. I haven't seen Porco since. Instead, I have found a very good friend in Miss Gina. Since the of the fight, there have been many wars. But I still keep in touch with Gina. After I take over the factory 'Piccolo', I make it a rule to spend summer vacations at the Hotel Adriano. Miss Gina has become more beautiful since. Old friends still stop by the Hotel all the time. Mr. Curtis, now I recall, writes to me sometimes though he is not the president of the U.S., yet. He says he longs for the summer of Adriatic Sea. It's only our secret that Gina won her gamble... End Thank you for watching \"],\n",
       " \"Kiki's Delivery Service\": ['But, first, here\\'s the weather forecast. Skies are clearing up, thanks to a high-pressure front moving in from the mountains. Mild winds will be blowing in from the west, pushing the clouds out by this evening. There\\'ll be a beautiful full moon lighting up the sky, so if you have been planning something special, tonight might be the night. Tomorrow also looks good with clear skies and sun. Jiji, wake up. Tonight\\'s the night. Hey, Mom. Hi, Miss Dora. Hey, Mom, it\\'s gonna be clear tonight. And guess what? The radio says there\\'ll be a full moon. Did you borrow your father\\'s radio again without asking? Don\\'t worry. He doesn\\'t mind. Please excuse me, Miss Dora. Mom, it\\'s a perfect midnight for me to leave home. You mean tonight? Next month is what you told me. Yeah. But the next full moon might be on a cloudy night. And I want to leave on the perfect midnight. Huh? But, Kiki... Wait. My, oh, my. What\\'s this all about? It\\'s one of our oldest customs that when a witch turns 13, she has to leave home for a year to begin her training. Your little baby is 13? My goodness, but time flies so quickly. I know. She seems so young to be leaving home now. I remember very well the exact day you arrived in this town. A little girl flew down from the sky on her broomstick. And I was certain she was much too young to hold such an important job as resident witch. Yes, but I could fly. Kiki barely knows how to do that. And I have had no time to teach her how to mix potions like me. Hmm. Young people are all the same. They all want to do something different. But I hope you at least get to teach her the potion that cures my rheumatism. Hurry up! We always said we\\'d leave on the perfect night. Didn\\'t we? Uh-uh. Our plan was that we would stick around for another month and play it safe. I like that plan. And if we put it off for a month, and I find some wonderful boyfriend, then what\\'ll we do? Come on, Jiji. I\\'m gonna put my paws together and pray you\\'re not serious. Of course I am. You know, ever since I turned 13, I\\'ve been excited about making this trip. There. Dad. Dad. Guess what? I\\'ve decided to leave tonight. - You\\'re going away? - Yeah. There\\'s a full moon. Well, yeah, but what happened to the camping trip we were supposed to take this weekend? Sorry, Dad. Uh! Kiki, Wait. Yeah, I\\'ll expect you then. Thanks. Hi, Mom, it\\'s me. I wanted to make sure you knew that Kiki is leaving tonight. Yes, midnight. Very pretty. Lilac would look prettier on me, or white. Witches have worn this color for a very long time, Kiki. Oh, Mom. I look really dumb. It\\'s not really important what color your dress is. What matters is the heart inside. Well, I\\'m gonna be the very best witch that I can be, Mom. And I know having a good heart is important. Just follow your heart and keep smiling. Yeah. And be sure to write home as soon as you\\'re settled. Okay. Dad. Oh, can I please take the radio? Mom, didn\\'t you say I could have the radio? Yay! - All right. It\\'s yours already. - Thank you. Well, now, you certainly look very grown-up, my little princess. Ta-da! You look just like your mother when she was young. I\\'m glad about that. Dad, can you lift me up high, like when I was little? Well... I don\\'t know. Here we go! How come you never told me you were growing up so fast? If things don\\'t work out, you can always come home. And come back a failure? Will you write us if you have the time? Mmm-hmm. After all, she is a baby. Aren\\'t you worried about Kiki living in a big city all alone?   Of course, they are. But Kiki will be just fine. - You\\'re gonna find a city by the ocean? - Or maybe a town? Uh-huh. That\\'s what I\\'m hoping anyway. Wow! You\\'re gonna have such a good time. I\\'m so jealous. You\\'ll have so much fun. But I\\'m not going just for a good time. In order to be a good witch, I have to train a year away from home. Yeah. Be sure to tell that to the boys. Kiki, it\\'s time. Okay. That\\'s the broom you\\'re going to be leaving on? Yup. I just made it this morning all by myself. Honey, it\\'s too small to be really safe. I\\'d rather you took my broom. I know it better. - But, Mom, that one\\'s so old. - And that\\'s why it\\'s good. You can rely on it time after time in any kind of weather. Now, Kiki, do this for me, please. But I put so much work into this one. Right, Jiji? Your broom is nice, but let\\'s take your mother\\'s. You\\'re no help. Now, Kiki, can\\'t you make yourself another fine broom when you get settled down? Mmm-hmm. Be careful. - You be strong. Okay? - I will. Bye, Kiki. - Fly safely. - Go get \\'em! Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go! Aim your broomstick. May our little baby be well and have a safe trip. I\\'m going to miss the wonderful sound of those bells. Mmm-hmm. - Where are we going? - I\\'m headed south to see the ocean. Jiji, climb up and turn on the radio. I don\\'t think I can handle it. Can you do it? Hey. Good evening. It was. You\\'re new, aren\\'t you? Yup! How\\'d you guess? I just left home tonight. Mmm-hmm. Would you mind turning off that radio? - I prefer to fly without being distracted. - Oh. Yeah, sure. Could you tell me? Is it really hard to get settled into a brand new city? Oh, yes. A lot can go wrong. But since my skill is fortune-telling,  I can handle anything. - Fortune-telling? - Yes. I tell fortunes about love. Wow! And what exactly is your skill? Um. Well, I haven\\'t really decided that yet. Ah. Well, I\\'m nearly finished with my training period. I\\'m going home soon to show off my new skills. - That\\'s my town down there. - It\\'s so big! Yes, to you I\\'m sure it looks big. - I hope you don\\'t have too tough a time. - Thanks. Ciao! Jeez, what a snob. And did you see that cat? What\\'s my skill? What are we gonna do? We can\\'t stay up! Hold on! We better rest here until it\\'s dry. - Won\\'t we get in trouble? - Not if nobody finds us. I\\'m soaked through down to the bone. Hello? Mmm. This smells great. Oops! Sorry. We didn\\'t mean to fall asleep in your breakfast. Wow! Jiji, you\\'ve gotta come see the ocean. It\\'s beautiful. Big deal. It\\'s just a big puddle of water. Look. Up ahead. How lovely. - I wonder if they have a witch there. - Oh, great. Ready, set, go! Hold on. You okay back there? Wow! This is just the kind of place I\\'ve always imagined. Wow! A clock tower. Look at this city. A place like this would be great to live in. But there may be some witches living here already. And there may not be. Look at how many people there are. Too many, if you ask me. Bless my hourglass. It\\'s a real, live witch. Good morning. - Do any witches live in this town? - Why... Nobody\\'s seen one around here in a long time. That\\'s great. Our trip is over. We\\'re staying right here. - Thanks, mister. Bye. - No problem. - Tell me we\\'re not landing down there. - Well, of course, we are. - They\\'re looking at us. - I know. Smile, so we make a good impression. Um. Hi. My name\\'s Kiki, and I\\'m a witch. And this is Jiji. He\\'s my black cat. And we\\'d be honored  if we could live here. Your city is so amazing. And what a beautiful clock tower. Really. That\\'s very nice, dear. Bye. Uh... Hey, you, kid. Who do you think you are, jumping out into the street like that? You were almost responsible for a big accident, zooming around on your broom back there. But I\\'m a new witch, sir. We\\'re supposed to fly around. You\\'re supposed to obey the law. I\\'m gonna have to write you up. Now give me your name and address. Will you tell my parents? Of course, I\\'m going to tell your parents. - I have to do that with every minor. - Thief! Thief! - Huh? - Somebody call the cops. - He\\'s getting away! - Now you stay right there. Uh, Kiki? Miss. Wait up. I sure fooled that cop, huh? Hey, that was me yelling \"thief.\" You\\'ll be okay now. Worked out pretty good, huh? You gotta be a real witch, the way you can fly that broom. Do you think maybe you can teach me how to fly it? Hey, Tombo. Maybe you can sweep her off her feet with that broom. Hey, shut up, all right? You know, miss, I love flying, too. Can I see your broom? Hey, wait! Thank you for getting me out of trouble. But I really shouldn\\'t be talking to you, and you wanna know why? It\\'s very rude to talk to a girl before you\\'ve been introduced and before you know her name. Hmph! Uh... Hmm. You\\'re kind of old-fashioned, aren\\'t you? - You sound like my grandmother. - Just go away and leave me alone! Hey! Don\\'t go. Hmm. What a cool witch. Stay here tonight? I\\'m afraid I don\\'t understand. Your parents are here with you, aren\\'t they? No, sir, I\\'m alone. I\\'ve come to this town because I\\'m a new witch in training. Do you have some identification? Oh, never mind. - Kiki, aren\\'t you going to eat that? - No, you can have it, Jiji. Where are we going to stay tonight?  Let\\'s go. Why don\\'t we go find another town? I\\'ll bet there are bigger and better ones. Ones that are friendlier than this. Oh, dear. Oh, my goodness. Hey, there! Your pacifier! Ma\\'am, you forgot your baby\\'s pacifier. Oh, poor baby. Without this, the baby\\'ll wake up and cry all the way home. I better go give it to her myself. I\\'m sorry, folks. But could you wait just a minute? I\\'ll be right back. Excuse me. But would you like me to deliver it for you? What? The woman with the baby carriage who just went around the corner. - I could reach her in no time. - Really? You\\'d do that? - Thank you so much. - My pleasure. Let\\'s go, Jiji. Wow! Sorry to surprise you, but the lady in the bakery asked me to return this pacifier. - Here you go. - Okay, I\\'d like one of those. Yes, sir. Oh, hi, there. Come in and wait a minute, will you? Mmm. These are nice and fresh. Just out of the oven. There you are. Here you go. See you tomorrow. Bye. And that\\'ll be all for you? All right. Thank you. Now, come back again. When I saw you fly off, I thought for a second I was dreaming. The baby\\'s mother told me to give you this message. Hmm? \"Thanks for returning the pacifier. \"Your new delivery girl is really quite special.\" - Well, I\\'ll be on my way. - Wait. Wait a minute. I really must do something to show you my thanks. Follow me. Bakery is downstairs. Upstairs is home. Sit down and relax. Would you like some hot chocolate? Okay. - There you go. - Thank you very much, ma\\'am. And, this is for you, little guy. So tell me if I\\'m right. I\\'m guessing you\\'re a witch in training. I really love it here. But people don\\'t seem to like witches in this town. Depends on the people. Now, take me, for instance. I just met you and I know I like you.  So, tell me, whereabouts are you two staying? - Uh... - Oh, I see. Why didn\\'t you tell me you have no place to stay? We have a spare room in the attic. You can use that. You\\'d really let me stay with you? Why, of course. But we haven\\'t introduced ourselves. - My name\\'s Osono. - And I\\'m Kiki, ma\\'am. And Jiji here is my very best friend. It\\'s right up here, Kiki. It may need a little dusting, but I think you\\'ll like it. Oh, my! It\\'s a little bit dustier than I remember. If I weren\\'t about to have a baby, I\\'d help you clean. - That\\'s okay. - All right, then. Water and bathroom are downstairs. Give a shout if you need anything. Thank you. - This is quaint. - Jiji. Hmph! If you wake up tomorrow and find a white cat, it\\'s me. Jiji, we can see the ocean from here. Can we look for a new town? Pardon me, Miss Snooty Cat. And the excitement is building for the moment when the big blimp appears in our skies. And so we\\'re gonna go to Scott, live, as he reports in from... Jiji, I\\'ve decided not to leave this town. Maybe I can stay and find some other nice people like Osono who will like me and accept me for who I am. ...and the ship making some kind of landing just so that everyone can get a closer look. And the amazing thing is there\\'s never been a dirigible this large and this safe before. How much do you think it would cost to get a phone here? - A phone? - Yup. We\\'re gonna need a phone. - Morning, everyone. - Well, look who\\'s up. - Did you sleep well? - Yes. Oh, that smells good. - Can I help out? - Sure can. Ooh, a delivery business, huh? Well, I really only have one skill, and that\\'s flying. So I thought a delivery service wouldn\\'t be a bad idea. It\\'s a great idea. Kiki\\'s Flying Delivery Service.  And since you\\'re staying right here, I can be your very first account. You mean it? Oh, that\\'s great. I was planning on putting a phone upstairs. - But a phone is so expensive. - I have a little saved up already. Don\\'t waste your money. What I think you should do is use our phone. You know, it will take some time to get regular customers. I\\'ll make you a deal. Since I\\'m expecting a baby, I could use help. If you mind the store once in a while, I\\'ll let you have the room and the phone. And I\\'ll throw in a free breakfast, okay? Yeah! We\\'ve got a deal. I\\'m gonna work very hard for you. Osono, you\\'re the greatest. Hmm? Jiji, come on. I\\'m all through. We\\'re gonna go shopping. Come on. Kiki, in the city, you can\\'t just run out into the street. I\\'m sorry. We\\'re still alive, aren\\'t we? You know how boys are. He\\'s so cute. I hope he\\'s still invited to her birthday party. - Don\\'t you? - Yeah. I wish I had something pretty to wear. My dress is so ugly. Wow! This costs so much. Kiki, look. It\\'s me. Any money left, Kiki? Not much. Looks like all we can afford to eat now is pancakes. Look, Jiji. Aren\\'t they beautiful? Hey. Pull over. Hey, there. Miss Witch, do you remember me? How come you\\'re not flying today? It\\'s me, you remember? Tombo. You can tell she\\'s a witch \\'cause she always wears a dark dress. Hey, wait. Come back, please. I didn\\'t mean to insult you. - Yeah. - Better luck next time, Tombo. Oh, Kiki, perfect timing. There\\'s a lady here who wants you to make a delivery. - She\\'s your first customer. - Customer? Oh, my! I\\'ll be right back. Dear, this lady is a customer of ours, and we were talking about your new delivery service. - What a charming girl. - My name\\'s Kiki, ma\\'am. Osono\\'s told me great things about you.  Do you think you can deliver this by tonight? Yeah. I can. It\\'s a birthday gift for my nephew. But something came up at work, and I can\\'t make it to the party on time. I can get it there for you, guaranteed. Show me on the map where you want it delivered. Huh? But that\\'s me. Are you sure it won\\'t be too far? - I can fly there straight from here. - Great. How much will it cost? Oh! Well, I haven\\'t really thought about a price. Aha! How about this much then? I hope it\\'ll be enough. What do you think? This much for me? That\\'s great. Thank you. Yeah. I got to see this. - She\\'s the most amazing girl. - She sure is. Hey, what can you tell me about her? Kiki, how high do you intend to go? This is my first job, and I do not want to be stopped by that traffic cop. Well, don\\'t look now, but that\\'s an airplane flying under us. Now, let\\'s see. Yup. It\\'s just past the cape. - Here we go. - Whoa, boy. I\\'m getting to like this town more and more. I\\'m getting sick to my stomach. I can\\'t wait to write Mom and Dad about my new business. Look who\\'s behind us. Wild geese. And they\\'re coming with us. Hi. - They seem awfully upset. - They say they\\'re going to fly higher. - Huh? - They say a gust of wind\\'s coming. Oh. Oh! A nest! Oh, I\\'m sorry. Leave me alone. I wasn\\'t trying to steal your eggs. Really. Oh, my goodness. Well, it\\'s your fault. The geese were kind enough to warn us of that wind. - But would you listen? - Oh, be quiet. Look at them. Up so high. That gust of wind took them all the way up. Kiki, we\\'ve got a problem. The toy fell out. We\\'ve gotta go back. They\\'re calling you an egg stealer. If I were you, I wouldn\\'t go back down there, again. We have to. Hold on! Hey. Stop that. Go away. Leave us alone. Stop it.  - Maybe we better rethink our plan. - Frankly, I think this is a major insult. Crows used to serve witches and do what you told them. That was a long time ago, okay? How about if we go in after dark? Go in. Get it. Get out. We won\\'t be able to make it in time. Unless we buy ourselves some time. You gotta be kidding. You can just pretend to be the doll until I find the real one. Don\\'t worry. Hold still. - Can I breathe? - No, no breathing. It must be my present from aunty. Yeah. Give it to me. This is dumb. You\\'re a bit late. After my sister telephoned, we were wondering where you were. Uh, I\\'m sorry. Um... Could I please have your signature, ma\\'am? Mom, can I put the canary in here? Uh-huh. But you be sure not to let it fly away, Ket. Okay. I\\'ve gotta run. Bye! Thank you. Enjoy your present. Come on, you stupid bird. I got a brand-new home for you. Please hurry, Kiki. I know you fell close by, so you\\'ve got to be here somewhere. There you are. Hello. Anyone home? Is anybody here? Anybody? Hello. - Anybody here? - Yes. Stop shouting. I\\'m on the roof. What do you want? Why don\\'t you come up? What do you want? Oh, well, you have a black cat in your cabin window, and, you see, it\\'s mine and I need it back. You\\'re a good birdie, aren\\'t you? So, why was it alone in the forest, huh? That\\'s where I dropped it. Um. May I have it back, please? I really need to finish this. That\\'s my girl. You\\'re just about through, okay? Well, why didn\\'t you tell me sooner why you needed it in such a hurry? He keeps me company. I\\'ve gotten sort of fond of him, you know? Thank you. Oh! Oh, no! His head\\'s falling off. Ooh, it must have been the crows. They were making such a big fuss over him. This is terrible. I can\\'t  deliver it like this. Hmm. Hey! I know. How about we work out a deal? So you\\'re on your own at 13. That\\'s pretty exciting. To be completely independent and a witch. Impressive. - How\\'s it going? - Trust me. He\\'ll be good as new. Almost done. Ket, dear. Turn Off the TV. Your birthday guests are gonna be here soon. Ket. Did you hear me? - Ket, turn off the TV! - Okay, okay. - I\\'m done. - Thank you very much. - Better go get Jiji before it\\'s too late. - But I haven\\'t finished yet. Don\\'t worry. You\\'ve done enough. Now, go on and get him. Thanks. Jeff likes my present more than me. Jeff\\'s such a funny dog. He simply adores that stuffed cat. He won\\'t leave it alone. I\\'ll bet he thinks it\\'s a puppy. He\\'ll be upset when Ket wants to take it and play with it. - He sure will. He sure will. - That\\'s okay. Just don\\'t forget to send your aunt a thank-you note. - Okay. Okay. - Ket. Well, I\\'m glad to see Jeff excited about something. He\\'s getting to be such an old dog. - Yeah. All he does is sleep all day. - All day. Ket, dear, go open the door. Jeff wants to go out. Jeff, shut the door when you\\'re done. Okay? - There you are. - What took you so long? - I\\'m sorry. - Jeff helped me escape. Kiki, if we ask him, I bet he\\'ll take the stuffed one back inside. He\\'ll do it. He\\'s a good dog. Could you take this in, please? - How are you? Hungry? - No, I\\'m tired. Yeah, me, too. I\\'m very tired. We\\'re both gonna sleep well tonight. By the way, that painter who found the stuffed cat told me she wants to do a drawing with me in it. - Naked? - Jiji. Boring. Wake up. You\\'re supposed to be minding the store. I am, but today this place is boring. But it always gets busy about this time. I know that. That\\'s not what I mean. I mean, my customers.  Jiji, if nobody comes in, I\\'m gonna have to eat pancakes forever and be fat, fat, fat. And what am I supposed to do about that? Well, I like pancakes, provided they\\'re not burned. Look, fur ball, when you get as fat and round as a pancake, you see if I care. Beautiful, isn\\'t she? They tell me she\\'s a clothes designer. Her designs may be fabulous, but her cat\\'s still a snob. Hello. Good Cooking Pan Bakery. What? Pardon? Uh, yes, ma\\'am. About time we got a customer, huh? Yes, ma\\'am, 4:30 will be a perfect time to pick it up. If you\\'ll just... And the address? Yes. The blue roof. Right. Yeah. I\\'m pretty sure I have it all. And thank you very much, ma\\'am. Hi. I\\'ll take this, please. Okay? Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Oh, come on. You\\'re not still mad at me, are you? Listen, we\\'re gonna have a huge party at the club tonight. It\\'s called the Aviation Club, and we\\'d really like for you to come. Here\\'s your invitation. It\\'s a serious club for kids who are into flying and aircraft and stuff. And, you know, everybody\\'d be really excited if you came. Yes. May I help you, sir? They tell me you have a delivery service. Uh, oh. I\\'m sorry. Yes, of course, we can handle it. It\\'s very urgent this package arrive as soon as possible. That\\'s no problem. Are you all right? - I do this every day. - Can I help you? Well, I hope you make up your mind by 6:00. \\'Cause that\\'s when I\\'ll be by to pick you up. - See ya. - How much will that be? Will that be inside or outside city limits, sir? - I wrote the address on the box. - Oh! Oh, the box. Oh, I\\'m sorry. Osono! Osono! I\\'ve got a big problem. I got an invitation to go to a party at Tombo\\'s flying club. I\\'m sure it\\'ll be a great party, Kiki. No. But my problem is,  what am I going to wear? Kiki, you haven\\'t got a problem. You look fine in that. Besides, it makes you look beautiful and mysterious. - Really? - How\\'s work? I almost forgot about that. It\\'s already 4:00. Oh, no. Can you watch the store until I get back, Osono? Jiji? Jiji? You were so mad at that boy. I don\\'t understand why you\\'re going to his party. Please don\\'t talk. I\\'m trying to fly this broom, okay? Thank you very much. Bye. Come on, Jiji. We can\\'t keep our next appointment waiting. There\\'s the blue roof. Here we are. My name\\'s Kiki, and someone telephoned for a delivery service, so here I am. Right this way, dear. - You are right on time. - Thank you. Oh, madam, the delivery girl is here. My, delivery time already? Come in, dear. Please make yourself right at home. - Please do. - Thanks. May I take that for you? Thank you. Broom and a black cat. Well, it\\'s just as my great-grandmother told me. - My name\\'s Kiki, and I\\'m a witch. - Mmm-hmm. Oh, my, what a pretty witch you are. I\\'m so sorry, but that special treat you were supposed to deliver isn\\'t ready yet. I think there\\'s something wrong with it. It\\'s got a mind of its own, and it doesn\\'t want to heat up. It\\'s old. Like me, it\\'s seen better days. I was hoping you\\'d be able to deliver a dish to my granddaughter\\'s birthday party. It\\'s my specialty, herring and pumpkin potpie. But I must admit defeat. I\\'ll have to phone her and tell her I\\'m sorry. I feel just awful having you come here for nothing. Barsa. Barsa. Would you get Kiki\\'s money, please? Certainly, madam. - All of it. Pay her what we agreed on. - Oh, no, I couldn\\'t. Please accept it. This was all my fault. Yes, but... Ma\\'am, since I don\\'t have any other jobs, maybe I can help. How about we use that old oven  over there? Well, maybe. It used to bake beautiful bread, but I haven\\'t baked in it lately. Well, if it burns firewood, I can help you. I used to help my mom bake all the time. But it\\'s such a big job to build a fire. A great idea, ma\\'am. I never liked that electric thing. - I think her plan is perfect. - Ma\\'am, it\\'ll work, really. You think so? All right then. Let\\'s try it. Don\\'t blame me if you\\'re late for your party. I can\\'t take her money and not help out. Let\\'s go. Madam, here. Look what I found. You\\'re a very clever girl, my dear. Your mother must be proud. Oh, well, this is exciting. Mmm-hmm. Yes, this is much better. It should be about time. Yes, the fire\\'s almost ready. Now we wait. You think 40 minutes should be about right? Exactly right. So why don\\'t we take a little break? Maybe I can help around the house while the pie is baking. Oh. How nice of you to offer. - What a wonderful witch. - There we go. You\\'re never gonna make the party on time. Stop worrying- It\\'ll only take me 15 minutes if I fly there fast. Would you like some hot tea? It\\'s no trouble. Dear! What did you say to me was the time of your party? It\\'s at 6:00, but it\\'s only 15 minutes away. Oh, my goodness. I\\'m afraid my clock runs about 10 minutes slow. - I\\'m gonna be late. - Check the potpie and see if it\\'s ready. Help. Barsa, come. Quickly! We have to hurry. Kiki is running very late. - Is the pie baked? Is it ready? - It seems fine. Now you\\'d better hurry. Uh-huh. - We\\'re ready. Come on. - Okay. Let me pay you for your time. - But that\\'s much too much. - Not for all of your help. Hurry up. Hurry up. - Have a good time now. - Here you go. - Bye-bye. - Fly carefully. We can beat the rain if we just fly a little faster.  Not according to my whiskers. Could we get out of the rain, please? I\\'m begging you. We can\\'t. That\\'ll make us even later, and the food will get cold if we stop. Yes? What do you want? - I have a delivery. - But it is soaking wet. Oh. Well, I\\'m sorry. It began to rain on the way. But don\\'t worry. The food came through all right. Oh, no. I told Grandma I didn\\'t want that. Hey, what\\'d you get? Oh, Grandma sent me another one of her crummy herring pies again. Mmm, yummy. Herring pie. Uh, will you please sign this receipt for me? I hate Grandma\\'s stupid pies. I cannot believe they\\'re related. Maybe we still have time. Kiki, there he is. Come on. We can catch him. Kiki, we were all so worried about you. And that poor boy waited such a long time. It doesn\\'t matter anyway. I can\\'t go in these wet clothes. Kiki, what\\'s wrong? Are you not feeling well? Maybe we should eat something, okay? Wake up, Kiki. Hmm? Not feeling very well, huh? - You have quite a fever. - My head\\'s hurting so much. Well, you flew in that weather and you never really dried off. - Do you think I\\'m going to die, Osono? - Huh? No, you\\'re not. I\\'ll bring some medicine right up, and maybe you should have some potpie. Not that. Well, then, I\\'ll just make something else for you. How about some nice hot oatmeal with honey in it? You want some, too? This oatmeal will pick you right up. There you go. Here. Now, don\\'t burn your tongue. You should come and eat your meal while it\\'s still warm. - Here it is. - Do I have to eat it? Only if you want to get well. Oh! You know that boy stopped by to see you again today. That\\'s right. When I told him you were sick, he asked me how a witch could catch cold in the first place. Oh. And he said he wanted  to visit you a little later. Oh, my gosh. No. Well, I thought you might feel that way, so I turned him down politely. You must be tired. You try to get some sleep. Now, I\\'ll just open up the window so you\\'ll have some fresh air. - Osono? - Hmm? Um... Never mind. Breakfast. Jiji. What? Mmm. Hmm... - Where are you? - Kiki? - Are you feeling better? - A lot better. Thank you. I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t realize I\\'d overslept. That\\'s okay. Come down later. I have a favor to ask you. - All right? - Okay. - The name is \"Koppori\"? - Uh-huh. Now, take this money. Oh, no, ma\\'am. No money. It\\'s on me. Impossible. Work is work, and make sure you deliver it in person. Jiji. - What is it? - We\\'ve got a delivery. - Hey. Who\\'s your friend there? - Lily\\'s her name. Be right there. Stay there. I\\'ll be right back. He\\'s all yours. Bye-bye. It\\'s so pretty and warm. Hey. Hey, there, Miss Witch. Taking a walk? Uh-uh. I\\'m looking for someone named Koppori. Hey, that\\'s my name. That\\'s me. If you go around that way, I\\'ll be right with you, okay? Okay. Osono, how could you do this to me? Hi. Gee, thanks a lot. About the other night. I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t show up. Huh? Mmm-mmm. I\\'m sorry you had to end up so sick like that. Hey, come over to my place. There\\'s something I wanna show you. Oh, you gotta see it. The party was to celebrate the completion of this thing. What do you think? This is the engine of a man-propelled plane. Watch this. We\\'re going to assemble the wings and the frame at somebody else\\'s house. I\\'m planning on flying this thing during most of my summer vacation. Miss Witch, I got a great idea. Why don\\'t we go down to the beach where that dirigible landed yesterday? - Dirigible? - Don\\'t tell me you didn\\'t hear about it?  - I was sick. - Then we gotta see it. Let\\'s do it. - We\\'re going on this? - Why not? I have to practice all the time anyway. Gotta build up my legs. Okay. Ready? Um... - This is my first time on a bike. - Oh, boy. Just hold on. Brace the bike with your foot until I get her revved up. Let\\'s go. Okay. Kick off. Now! Good! - Should I get off? - No. Hey, look at that. Whoa. Bye! Lean your body to the inside when we go around the curve. Why? Because otherwise we\\'re gonna have trouble turning. Now. Great. You\\'re doing fine. Now, put your weight into it again. That\\'s it! We\\'re quite a team. All right. We\\'re doing great. Wow. - That\\'s the dirigible, right? - Right. We\\'re flying. Oh, my God! Uh, boy! What happened, Tombo? Are you okay? - Yeah. Are you? - I\\'m okay. What are you laughing at? - Hmm? - Your face. Do I really look that funny? I\\'m sorry, but when we flew up, I was so scared. Yeah, me, too. Was it your magic that made us stay up? I\\'m not sure. Anything\\'s possible. Your bike\\'s a real mess. My propeller. I have to go get it, Kiki. Will you keep an eye on my bike for me? - Uh-huh. What went wrong? - I think I pedaled too hard. That\\'s why it busted. You wait here. I\\'ll be right back. How great would it be to go around the world in a dirigible like that? Of course, you were flying since you were very young, huh? Well, yes. Since I was a baby. My mother used to take me with her. She taught me never to be scared. Gosh. You\\'re so lucky, Kiki. I wish I could fly. People like you can just fly away on a broomstick. But me? That\\'s all I can do. Flying used to be fun until I started doing it for a living. Hey, wait. You can\\'t not enjoy flying. You\\'re a witch. I know. I still feel that way though. But I\\'m very glad I came with you today.  I feel much better sitting by the beach. Why don\\'t I bring you here whenever you want and train myself at the same time? - You\\'re a very nice person. - Huh? You just found that out? Sorry. But at first I thought you were such a clown. You know, my mom says the same thing. \"Don\\'t be such a clown. \"Quit looking up at the sky, and get back to your books.\" - Look at him. - Tombo! - Hey, Tombo! - Huh? - Guess what\\'s up, Tombo? - What? Something really great. You\\'re gonna love it. Come on over. I\\'ll be back in a sec, okay? We\\'re all gonna get to go for a ride in the blimp. Really? Wow! That\\'s great. Hey, who\\'s your friend? That\\'s Kiki. I\\'ll get her to come over. Hey, come over and meet the gang, Kiki. We\\'re all going for a tour inside the Spirit of Freedom. - Thanks, but I don\\'t want to. - Oh. Why not? It\\'ll be fun. She made a delivery to my house on my birthday. - You mean, she\\'s working, at her age? - Well, I\\'ll be. Come on. I\\'ll introduce you to everybody. - No thanks. See you later. - What\\'s the matter? Hey! What are you so mad about? I\\'m not mad at all, Tombo. I have a lot on my mind. So, please, just leave me alone. Huh? Forget her, Tombo. Come on. And don\\'t forget that this summer, the hit music... Jiji, I think something\\'s wrong with me. I meet a lot of people, and at first everything seems to be going okay, but then I start feeling like such an outsider. You should have seen how Tombo\\'s friends looked at me. Hey, where are you going? Oh. Some friend you are. Kiki\\'s Delivery Service Hey! You know, you can\\'t be late for every meal just because you have a new girlfriend. And you can wash your plate yourself. Why are you talking like a cat? Huh? Oh, my. Oh, no. Talk to me, Jiji.  You mean you can\\'t speak anymore? Jiji? What\\'s going on with him? I can\\'t understand anything he\\'s trying to say. What if it means... Oh, my goodness. I\\'m losing my witch\\'s powers. What do you mean? You haven\\'t lost your magic, have you? It\\'s become very weak, so I... Well, I think I\\'ve got to take a break from my delivery work. But I promise I\\'ll be really good with my work in the bakery, so please let me stay in the room upstairs. Well, that\\'s no problem. I\\'ll bet your powers come back after you\\'ve had some rest. I really don\\'t know. Maybe if I make a new broom. Hey. Look at that. Hi, Kiki. It\\'s me, Tombo. Did you see me today? I was waving at you from the dirigible, \\'cause the captain let me come into the control cabin during the test run. Boy, did I have a cool time. - Hello? Kiki? Are you there? - Please don\\'t call me anymore. What did you say? I can barely hear you. You know what the captain said... What? Kiki? She hung up. What\\'s the matter, dear? Is there anything I can do for you? I\\'m still in training to become a witch. If I lose my magic, that means I\\'ve lost absolutely everything. Kiki. Uh-huh. It\\'s right over there across the street. Kiki? Kiki? Hey! - Hi. - Hi. Well, since you didn\\'t come and visit me, - I thought I\\'d come here and visit you. - I\\'m sorry. Well, that\\'s sort of a white lie. I need to do some shopping, too. Come on in, \\'cause I\\'m done now, and I can take a break, okay? You better believe I will. Nice place you have. Help yourself to some of these, and I\\'ll go make us some tea. No tea, thanks, but some milk if you have any. Sure. Hey, there. Unbelievable. You\\'re the spitting image of that stuffed cat. I bet your name\\'s Jiji, right? Coming through. So, how\\'s the delivery biz?  You making any money? - That bad, huh? - I\\'m not working much now. Mmm-hmm. Hmm. I kind of thought you looked unhappy. I didn\\'t know things like that happened to witches. Hey! Why don\\'t you come and stay at my cabin? Huh? It\\'ll probably make you feel better. Your boss would let you have a break. How about it, kitty-cat? Wanna come? Hmm? Rather be with your girlfriend, huh? Come on, girl. Why not? We\\'ll leave now. Uh-huh. Come on. Hurry. Hurry. The bus is leaving. Okay, now I\\'m officially exhausted. It\\'s beautiful here. What\\'s the matter with you? Must\\'ve been blinded by two beautiful girls in front of him. Hey! Huh? You really thought I was a boy? Well, it\\'s the way you\\'re dressed and all. Tell me. What kind of a boy has these legs, mister? - You get along with the crows. - Yup. We\\'ve become real close friends. - Wow! - Hello, everybody. I\\'m home again. Good afternoon. I wanna say I\\'m sorry. Why don\\'t you go inside, and I\\'ll go get some water? Okay. - Like it? - Yes. I have to say I became inspired after the first time we met. But I really haven\\'t got the face right. I\\'ve been waiting for you to come back so I can try again. - You mean that\\'s me? - Sure is. You\\'d make my life easier if you\\'d model for me. But I\\'m not very beautiful. What do you want me to do that for? Come on, Kiki. You have got a great face. You\\'re very pretty. Now, don\\'t you be nervous. Sit down over here. Raise your chin up a little. Look straight ahead. Now, don\\'t move. Painting and magical powers seem very much the same. Sometimes I\\'m unable to paint a thing. You mean it? Then what? What happens? Kiki, please, don\\'t move. It\\'s hard to draw a moving target. Without even thinking about it, I used to be able to fly. Now I\\'m trying to look inside myself  to find out how I did it. But I just can\\'t figure it out. You know, it could be you\\'re working at it too hard. Maybe you should just take a break. Yeah, but still, if I can\\'t fly... Then stop trying. Take long walks. Look at the scenery. Doze off at noon. Don\\'t even think about flying. And then, pretty soon, you\\'ll be flying again. - You think my problems will... - Go away? That\\'s right. It\\'s gonna be fine. I promise. When I was your age, I\\'d already decided to become an artist. I loved to paint so much. I\\'d paint all day until I fell asleep right at my easel. And then one day, for some reason, I just couldn\\'t paint anymore. I tried and tried, but nothing I did seemed any good. They were copies of paintings I\\'d seen somewhere before, and not very good copies, either. I just felt like I\\'d lost my ability. That sounds like me. It\\'s exactly the same, but then I found the answer. You see, I hadn\\'t figured out what or why I wanted to paint. I had to discover my own style. When you fly, you rely on what\\'s inside of you, don\\'t you? Uh-huh. We fly with our spirit. Trusting your spirit. Yes, yes! That\\'s exactly what I\\'m talking about. That same spirit is what makes me paint and makes your friend bake. But we each need to find our own inspiration, Kiki. Sometimes it\\'s not easy. I guess I never gave much thought to why I wanted to do this. I got so caught up in all the training and stuff. Maybe I have to find my own inspiration. But am I ever going to find it? And is it worth all the trouble? Well, for example, there were quite a few times when I thought of painting something over that painting. But it ended up being so great. So I guess it\\'s worth it. Today when I saw you, I thought, \"I wanna paint.\"  - You\\'ve got such a great face. - That\\'s why I came? Hey, well, it\\'s better than you cleaning my floor again. - Let\\'s turn out the lights and go to sleep. - Okay. Sorry about taking your bed from you. Ah, no problem. - So you really think I\\'ll fly again? - Sure. You\\'ll just have to wait for the right inspiration to come along. - You understand? - Uh-huh. And there it is, folks, the Spirit of Freedom. Recently downed in a spectacular forced landing... due to torrential rains just outside the city limits. Well, it\\'s been repaired, and is now in final preparation... Yes? Good Cooking Pan Bakery. Kiki. How are you? Well, you take plenty of time coming home. Oh, and by the way, that older woman you made a delivery for? - Uh-huh. - She has another delivery for you. I said I wasn\\'t sure you could do it. She was really very insistent. What do you think, Kiki? Great. Stop there on your way back. Bye. Thank you so much for everything. - Afternoon, ma\\'am. - Well, well, we\\'ve been expecting you. Thanks. There are less than five minutes to takeoff now. Um. It\\'s very nice to see you again, ma\\'am. I\\'m glad you came. Please excuse me for not standing. My legs are bothering me more than usual. - Barsa, bring the package now. - Gosh, I hope it hasn\\'t taken off. Not yet. Barsa is absolutely mad about lighter-than-air travel. - I\\'m the adventuresome type. - Mmm-hmm. Could you turn it down, please? Would you do me a favor and open the box? Yup. I don\\'t get it. Would you please bring this to a young delivery girl? She was kind to me and a very big help. It\\'s my way of saying thank you. Ah, yes, and can you find out when her next birthday is? Then I can bake her another one. Kiki? Of course, I will. And maybe the young  girl will want to know the lady\\'s birthday, because she\\'ll be able to give her a present to repay her. You\\'ve got a deal. - What happened? - Oh, there\\'s been a terrible accident. Oh, darn this old thing. And just when it was getting good. Midsummer is always when these winds come. They\\'ll be hitting us any minute. Goodness. It\\'s a strong one. It\\'ll pass quickly. Don\\'t worry. Oh, goody! It\\'s back on. Look. Oh, look at that. It\\'s completely upside down. Freak winds blowing in from the sea. - It has broken loose from... - My, my. How terrible. A desperate last-ditch effort is being made to tie the dirigible to the ground and keep it from drifting into the air. But it\\'s extremely doubtful whether or not this can actually be done. Oh, no, no. It\\'s useless. The tremendous lifting power of the helium balloon is lifting the police patrol car... That\\'s Tombo. That\\'s my friend hanging on that rope. It\\'s being lifted like a toy. Oh, no, there\\'s a young boy hanging onto the cable. He\\'s being lifted away together with the police car. I don\\'t believe what I\\'m seeing. The dirigible is being blown towards town. - Are you sure it\\'s your friend, my dear? - I have to go. - Be careful. - Oh, dear. Oh! Oh! - Come on. Over here. - Over here. Hold on there, son. Just hold your grip steady. Release the helium from the tail. Quick! All citizens are kindly requested to remain calm. Sir, is there any word about the boy? All I know is that the radio said that the police car dropped into a pool. He\\'s still up there. Stay out of the street. Get on the sidewalks. You there. Young lady. Don\\'t block the street. Do not block the street. Are you all right, young lady? Please, sir, may I use your broom for a minute? - What? - Please. I promise I\\'ll bring it right back.  Huh? I\\'m not gonna give you my broom... - Thank you very much. - Hey! Fly. Watch out! Come on, broom, fly for me. Ladies and gentlemen, it appears that the blimp is heading directly for the clock tower. And look! The young boy is safe, but he\\'s clutching that rope for dear life. If the wind doesn\\'t shift, the Spirit of Freedom will smash into the tower! We gotta get up higher or else we\\'ll hit the tower, Captain. There\\'s not enough helium. Jump onto the tower before we hit. Aye, aye, Captain. Hey, there. Over here. Come on. Get outta the way. The blimp\\'s gonna crash! Grab a hold of this. Go! Hurry up! Hey! We are listening to the sound of a helium gas leak. The condition of the boy is unknown, but from where I\\'m standing... It\\'s falling. Too much gas has escaped. It\\'s coming down! It\\'s snagged on the building across the street... Hey, look. Over there. It\\'s a miracle. The young boy has somehow managed to keep his hold on the rope. But how can anyone rescue him now? That brave young boy is hanging on for dear life. He can\\'t... Something just flew by. It\\'s a bird? No, it\\'s not a bird. It\\'s a young girl. No. It\\'s a young witch soaring through the sky, and she\\'s riding... - Go, Kiki. - Oh, my. She can fly again. Get him, Kiki. - Tombo. - Kiki. Tombo. Come on. Be a good broom. Hold on, Tombo. Hang in there, my good lad. - Kiki. - Tombo. And she\\'s trying to reach the boy! - You can do it. Yes. - Don\\'t give up now, sonny. Come on! Don\\'t give up. Don\\'t give up. Don\\'t give up. Don\\'t give up. Don\\'t give up. She got him. She saved the boy. I\\'ve never seen anything so amazing. Congratulations, young lady. Now, she\\'s bringing him down to land, safe and sound. She actually caught the boy in midair.  You saw it all live as she saved his life. That broom she used was mine. That was my broom, you know. Oh, Barsa. Oh, my. Kiki was so brave. She really saved the day. Better call the hospital, honey. I think it\\'s time now. Jiji. Hey! Listen, we just got a letter from Kiki. Huh? \"Dear Mother and Father, How are you doing? \"I\\'m happy to say that Jiji and I are doing fine at the moment.\" My delivery service is a big success. I\\'ve really started to gain some confidence and everything is falling into place. There are still some times when I feel a little homesick, but all in all, I sure love this city. '],\n",

Boss! A girl from the sky... Boss, a girl from the sky... #@% worn-out engine! Boss, a girl... Close the #2 valve! Pazu, hand me a wrench. Yes, sir! I can't let go! You do it! Don't keep the people down below waiting. Yes, sir! Keep calm...you can do it. Yes, sir! Brake! How was it? It's no use. The silver isn't concentrated anywhere. Digging here is useless... Shouldn't we have dug to the east? That place is just full of old pits. We'll just have to do it over again, won't we? Yes...all over again... That's it... Put out the boiler fire. No overtime tonight. Times are hard. We'll end up starving. Pazu, oil that run-down engine. Yes, sir! It's no use, Mama. We can't find anything in the dark. You think we've searched thoroughly, eh? There's not a trace. We'll start again when it gets light. Well, how do you feel? Hey, wait! Wait, I said! I'm Pazu. I live alone in this house. When I'm done playing, I give them this. I'm relieved. Anyway, you look human. Until a little while ago, I was worried you were an angel or something. Thanks for saving me. I'm Sheeta. Sheeta...that's a nice name. I was surprised by the way you fell out of the sky. I see...Why do you suppose I was saved? After all, I fell out of an airship. You don't remember? Say - can I see that for a minute? This? It's been in my family for generations. A pretty stone, isn't it? Just a second. Watch! Pazu! Looks like it wasn't the stone after all. Pazu, hold on... Are you okay? Yes. And you? I'm fine. Does it hurt? Yes. My head hurts from Boss's fist. Oh, yeah. The pot is boiling. Let's go in and eat. You can wash up over there. There are towels, too. Thank you. Sheeta! Sheeta, ready yet? That's a photograph my father took from an airship. Laputa is an island floating in the sky. An island that floats in the sky? Yeah. They say it's just a legend... but my father saw it! That's the photograph he took. Swift wrote about Laputa in 'Gulliver's Travels', but that was just a story. Father drew this from his memory! There's no one living there any more. There's supposed to be a lot of treasure there. But, nobody believes in it. Father died in Sagi, looking for it. But, my father's not a liar. One day I'll prove it! I'll discover Laputa. An automobile...how rare!   They're pirates. They're the ones who attacked the airship. They're after you? Hurry, this way! Good morning! Hey! Wait! What? I'm in a hurry! Has a new girl come to these parts? Baby Madge! She came to Boss's place yesterday. Damn! A coincidence! They're after you, alright. Louie! A girl's dress! What? Disguised? You tell Mama! ...haven't seen her. A cute girl, with dark hair in braids? Boss! Boss! Just about that age... Brother! That's her! They're pirates! They're after this girl. Pirates! Look! That's far enough. We'll get her. Pirates, huh? The Dora Clan. Leave us alone. We're just a poor lot. Mom! Escape out the back! I want to fight, too! They have weapons. But... You'll be a good boy, won't you? Protect her. In any case, we'll get her somehow. Think you're man enough? Settle this with your fists. All right. Do it, brother! Oh, my...show him, Duffy! Wow... And who sewed that shirt? Brother, don't give up! Go! Go! They think they can fool me, do they? Follow them! Get on! Let's go! Pazu - taking the day off? We're being chased. It's the Dora Clan. Pirates? Give us a ride to the next city, and we'll go to the police. All right. Help stoke it! Stupid sons of mine...hurry up and get in! But the girl's in there. She snuck out the back door. Get moving. Wait! Pazu, they're on to you! Can't we go any faster? She's pretty old. Let's change places! Mama, I'm going to fall! More steam...they're gaining on us! Faster! Sheeta, come here! Take care of the stoking! Don't give up! Push! Keep pushing! Hold it! They won't get away. Don't just sit there... push these things off the track! There...running fine! I'll do it. We'll do it together. Wait! It's them, Mama. What'll we do? I'm not giving up just yet! Let's move!  We're blocked. It's the army. Hey, please help out these kids. They're being chased by pirates. Farewell! Wait! Stop! Stop, or I'll shoot! It's an armored tank! I don't care! Ram it! Sheeta, what's the matter?! Don't ask! They'll fall! Be quiet. Watch closely! We're floating! See that? The power of the Levistone! It WAS the stone after all! Amazing! It's okay. This way we'll go to the bottom. AMAZING! I want it! Fire! Excellent! I WILL get my hands on it! It's going out. Oh, wait...! It did that when you came floating down, Sheeta. The entrance looks so small. I hope nothing bad happens to your boss or the engineer. It's okay. Miners are tough. Let's go. Since long ago, the mountain's been riddled with mine shafts. Here. Oh, good. I'm awfully hungry. There's an apple and two candies for later. Your bag is like magic. It has everything in it. Gondoa? That's in the northern mountains, isn't it? Yes. When my parents died, they left me the house and farm. I managed alone, somehow. You were kidnapped by those men with dark glasses? The same men we saw? Who could it be...with such an army... Both Dora and the 'dark glasses' want to get the stone... I had no idea there was such a mysterious power in this stone. It has been handed down through my family, since times long past. Mother gave it to me when she died, telling me never to show it or give it to strangers. So, we're both orphans. Forgive me for getting you mixed up in my troubles, Pazu. Don't worry. When you fell from the sky, my heart was pounding. I knew it was the start of something wonderful. Imps...They're imps... Grandpa Pomu! It's okay. He's a very nice man. We're lost! This imp looks just like Pazu... and a little girl imp, too, I see.  PWe're being chased by pirates... P: P...and by the army, too. Intrepid, aren't you... Well, help yourself. Thank you. Grandpa, do you always stay underground? That's impossible! Since last night, the stars have been making a mysterious commotion... I hope they quiet down soon. The rocks make noise? The stones have small voices... Wow. Pazu - look up. But it was just rock... It's pretty. Now, look at this. It went out. There are Levistone veins inside the rocks here. Levistone? This happens when Levistone touches the air. It fades and becomes just rock. It's glowing. I'm amazed! That's a pure Levistoncrystal... I'm beginning to see n... It's no wonder the stars are so restless! There's a mysterious power in this stone. Only the people of Laputa had the power to make such a thing. The people of Laputa... That was when it floated in the sky over Dekkai Island. There really was a Laputa! Sheeta, it exists, after all. Grandpa, where do you think the island is now? Grandpa Pomu? Sorry, but could you put away the stone? It's too much for me. What's the matter, Grandpa? My grandpa told me... When the stones are noisy, Laputa is over the mines. So, if we went up into the sky now, we could see Laputa! Sheeta, my father wasn't lying! Uhh...Little girl...Umm... Yes? I tell others about stones because that's how I make a living. Listen, the good luck the stones bring people also seems to invite bad luck. What's more. That stone was made by human hands. Remember that... It's not like that! That stone has saved Sheeta twice already, hasn't it? This is amazing! Laputa is real. They've gone. Let's go back to the ship, Mama. Keep quiet. We'll stay here for now. I'm hungry. It's okay, let's go. Thanks, Grandpa. Be careful.  Wow...what magnificent clouds... The island is floating, hidden behind the peaks of those clouds. I'll do it! I swear I'll find Laputa! Pazu... There's something I still haven't told you... There's an old, secret name in my family. When I inherited this stone, I inherited that name as well... My inherited name is Lucita... Lucita Toelle Ul Laputa. Laputa - then...! It's the army! Run, Sheeta! Run to the cave! Don't move! What are you doing?! Pazu! Let me go! We've caught them, sir. Did they give you a lot of trouble? Open up! Open up! This is too slow! She'll talk as soon as we lock her up! That's a bad habit of the government. Rush things and both the girl and the investment will suffer, your Excellency. If we'd mobilized the troops in the first place, Dora wouldn't have surprised us. Your Excellency, the coded messages were deciphered. What?! This is a job for my agents. Your Excellency need only move the troops at the right time. Muska! I am the commander of the Laputa investigation. Don't forget that! Of course; and I take my orders directly from the government. Don't forget that. Meddling fool! Did you sleep well? Where's Pazu? I want to see Pazu! Don't you like the latest fashions? Don't worry about him. His head is harder than mine. Come, there's something I want you to see. Go in. What is it...? It has terrible destructive power. It's a robot soldier. If this fellow hadn't fallen out of the sky, nobody would have believed in Laputa. This wasn't made anywhere on the Earth's surface. It has power almost beyond imagining. And its body...metallic? Ceramic? Our scientists still don't know. Look at this. Don't be afraid. It's been inactive since we found it. There. The same symbol that was on the old fireplace in your home...  ...and on this necklace. This stone won't work except in your hands. It will protect you until the day you decide to return to Laputa, then it will show you the way. But, I don't know anything! If you want the stone, take it! Leave us alone. You think Laputa is kind of a 'treasure island', don't you? Laputa flies because of an impressive scientific power. It once controlled the whole surface of the Earth with an empire of fear! If a thing like that is still wandering in the skies, is it not a danger to peace? I think you understand. I'd like you to help me. Laputa's location is in the stone. Surely you must know an incantation or something? I really don't know. Let me see Pazu. I don't like to be overdramatic, but that young man's fate is in your hands. If you help us, I'll set him free, Lucita Toelle Ul Laputa. How did you know that? 'Ul' means king in Laputan. 'Toelle' means true. You are the rightful successor of the Laputan royal family, Queen Lucita. Come out. Pazu, are you hurt? I'm okay. But you? They haven't done anything to you, have they? Pazu, I was wrong about you. Please forgive me. I didn't know that you were fighting to protect her from the pirates. Sheeta...what? Pazu, I beg you. Forget about Laputa. What? The army will investigate Laputa with Sheeta's help. I understand how you feel, but I'd like you to keep 'hands off' for a while. Sheeta...is this true? But... Forgive me for troubling you. Thank you. I'll never forget you, Pazu. It can't be...Sheeta...didn't you promise? Goodbye. Wait, Sheeta! If you want to be a man then listen to reason! This is a small, but heartfelt thanks. Take it and go. Remember the words that activate the stone... If you keep your promise, you'll be set free, too.  Mama, it's Pazu. Pazu came back! I was worried. Nobody had seen you since yesterday. What happened to that little girl? She's all right. Let me go...what are you doing?! Don't make a fuss. Only staying for a bit, my boy. Get out! This is my house! Big talk for a brat who can't even protect a little girl. Look at all the money he's got! Oh dear, you sold the girl for money? You're wrong! I wouldn't do a thing like that! Then where did you get the money? Sheeta told me to take it! So, I... So you took it and ran... And you call yourself a man? Don't give me that! Weren't you trying to get hold of Sheeta, too? Of course. Pirates are always after treasure! They're strange fellows. Why do they keep kidnapping the girl? Do you think they'll let the girl live? Idiot! She was forced to deal with them to save you! You understand everything, don't you, Mama? I haven't been a woman for 50 years without learning something. Don't you see? She saved your life. Just breaks my heart, it's true love and you don't even shed a tear. If any of you ever marry, find a nice girl like her. Don't you mean like you, Mama? Like that girl? Good...still using the old code! They've summoned a warship. They're leaving with the girl. If we don't hurry, we'll lose them! Move your butts! Let's go! Are you going to go kidnap Sheeta? The girl is nothing, it's the Levistone! But the Levistone by itself is useless! If Sheeta doesn't hold the stone, it won't work! Auntie, won't you take me with you? I want to save Sheeta. You won't be pampered. If you go, you'll have to take care of yourself. I will. If I have the strength, I'll protect her. The treasure of Laputa is worth it! Please... Oh, you're making her cry. Shut up! We don't know if the girl  will listen to us, do we? We won't have a second chance. Understood. You'll follow orders? Don't take more than 40 seconds to pack. Take care, everyone. Fasten yourself with this belt. The rest of you, wait on the ship. What an excellent ship! Muska, has the girl talked? I need a little more time. There'll be plenty of time in the air. We leave at dawn with the girl. Hurry up! It'll soon be light! That's too bad. So, Sheeta, I'll tell you something good. A spell for times of trouble. A spell? That's right. Very old, secret words. Lete Latobarita Ulse Aliaros Baru Netoreel It's to save us. It is a wish, 'Light, be reborn'. Lete Latobarita Ulse Aliaros Baru Netoreel Excellent! It was in an old manuscript... this is a holy light... Holy light? What kind of incantation was it? Tell me the words. It's moving! The robot... the robot's alive. Hello?! Help! It's crazy! It's moving. Put out the fire. It's the robot! The robot?! Where does it think it's going? Amazing! I see! It's that light! The seal on the robot was broken by the holy light. It has opened the way to Laputa! Come here! It can fly?! It's nuts! It's piercing the sky. Laputa is in the same direction as that light. Not ready yet? Hurry up! Blasting powder? You idiot; do you want to blow up this fort? Hello? Hello? Hey, what's wrong?! Okay. It's connected. This is Captain Muska. Communication lines are down because of the robot. Take emergency action. I am in temporary command. The robot is trying to get to the girl on the East tower. Kill it the moment it shows itself. Leave fuses off the shells. Don't hurt the girl. Hurry! Hurry! Fire! Forward! It's flattened. Alright! Get the girl! Is she dead? Hey...get up. She's just fainted.  Stand up! It moved! What's going on? Looks like a war. Let's go, Auntie! Call me Captain! Charles, fly a little lower. Stop! Stop, already! Please! Mama, the Goliath is moving! If they go, we'll end up flying right into their guns. There she is...it's Sheeta. What? Where? Straight ahead! She's on the top of the small tower! That's a brave girl! Cover us! Sheeta, come on! Auntie, a little closer! Go up! This is our last chance. Grab her as we pass! Go! Get out of the way! Damn! What is the Goliath doing? A smoke screen? Muska, what happened to the robot? The robot was destroyed. The girl has escaped. What? Look sharp...put out the fires! Form search parties! It hasn't lost its holy light. It's still showing the direction of Laputa. Inform the General tt we will depart for Laputa as planned. Nice, isn't she. Hard to believe she'll grow up to be just like Mama. Here's your valley. Glad to be rid of such a useless pair. Auntie, please let us ride on your ship. Call me Captain! You don't have the stone. Why should I let you on board? We'll repay you. I want to see Laputa with my own eyes. What if there isn't any treasure? You're not greedy enough to ride a pirate ship, anyway. Mama, can she come along? If there's any funny business, I'll throw you into the sea! Hurray! A live-in cook. A dishwasher! A potato peeler! Can you make pudding? I like mincemeat pie! And me...well, now, let me see... I'll eat anything! Behave yourselves! Really! Just like children. Careful! It's canvas! This ship is made of canvas! Don't damage it. Don't just stand there! It's crowded here. Hurry up...this way! I hate slackers! You...this way. He's fine. Come on! You aren't here to play! What an amazing engine. Where'd he go? Uncle! Uncle!  Uncle...here's the asstant you wanted. NOT SO LOUD!! I ain't deaf. He's worse than Mama. Be careful. It's so cramped, my hand won't go in. It's this packing, isn't it. What's your name? The Levistone pointed due east, did it? From the tower, I could see the sun rise. Now is the mowing season. So the sunrise is a lite south of true east. The sun rose left of the hills. The Levistone light crossed the left tip of the sun's edge. Good answer. How are things up there? I'm getting nothing. So, they're jamming the radio to hide their whereabouts, are they?! Mama, the Goliath's moving pretty fast! What'll we do? We'll be on their windward side. If we use the trade winds... 20,000 feet and ridehe jet stream... With wind speed 10... We'll do it somehow Everybody, listen up! We are setting course for Laputa. Our ship will now commence top-speed pursuit! Using the wind, we should be able to make contact tomorrow! And I'll give 10 gold pieces to the first to spot her! 10 gold pieces! Laputa is some sort of flying island. There's probably enough treasure for everybody. So! Everybody...GET TO WORK! Now! Course 98. Velocity 40! There's nothing your size. Put this on. Here's your post. Five meals a day. Conserve water. You morons! Get back to work! Sorry, dinner isn't ready yet. It's my first airship kitchen. Did you want something? I have some spare time, so I thought I'd be of some help. Well, thank you. Would you do that washing? No problem. Hey, you said your back hurt. I had some spare time and thought I'd help. Out of the way. Don't push. Hey, can I be of some help? So, you were scared too? And they have the Goliath to help them... Sounds hopeless. It's the island of Laputa, so it's no wonder. They're certainly good kids, those two.  What do you want me to say, you stupid old man? Nothing. But you should show me more respect. What?! That's checkmate, isn't it? Umm...if anyone wants seconds... Seconds! Hey! Get up. It's your watch. Take this, it's cold out. The lookout? Yeah. It's cold! You're up top. I'm second shift. Thanks. That was scary! It's beautiful. Get in. Can't sleep? It's warm. Sheeta, you look behind. I'm scared beyond words. The truth is, I don't want to go to Laputa at all. I hope we don't find the Goliath. There are just too many strange and powerful...well... You mean like what happened with the robot? That was sad, wasn't it. And it happened because of a spell taught to me by my grandmother. I learned many other spells, too. To find things, and to cure illness and words I must absolutely never use... Words you must never use? Spells of destruction, good spells to bestow power... She said I must also know the bad words but never use them. After I learned them, I was too afraid to sleep. And it all had to do with the stone. It was always hidden in the fireplace, and except at weddings, never used... Mother, and Grandmother, and Grandmother's Grandmother... everybody feared it! I wish it had never existed! You're wrong. I met you, thanks to that stone. And thanks to that stone, Laputa won't be lost. All our progress with flying machines, and no one's seen it but my father. And what if Laputa is really an island of terror? It mustn't fall into the hands of Muska and the others. Besides...if we run away now, we'll be chased forever. But I don't want to make you a pirate for my sake. I won't become a pirate. Even Dora understands. I think she's really a good person. When this is all over, I'm sure she'll take you back to Gondoa.  I want to see it. The old house where you were born, and the yaks. What's that?! Underneath the ship...there! It's the Goliath. It's right below us! Hard to starboard! Muska, why aren't we chasing them? They'll get away! It's no use, in the clouds. Anyway, they can't run far! We're on course and everything's going smoothly. The course was more north. Pazu, there's no time. Listen up! If we don't shake off the Goliath, we're finished! You have good eyes. I want you to stay in the lookout. If we leave the clouds, they'll pursue. What should I do? That lookout post will turn into a kite. There should be a handle inside. Found it! If you turn it clockwise, the hook will catch. If you turn the upper handle, the wings will open! When it's open, don't stretch the wire. Remember to steer with your body! Is Sheeta up there? You better come back down! Why? WHY? Because you're a little girl! Auntie, you're a girl, too! Besides, I'm mountain-bred. I have good eyes, too. Please... Pazu agrees with me! If you go up, don't use the voice tube. There's an internal telephone. Is this the phone you were talking about, Auntie? Wow. Yes...we'll try. Let us up! Go! I can't see it. They've dived into the clouds. Be careful. They may not be in front of us. Okay! Hang on tight! What's wrong?! Turbulence...we're okay! Just a little stirred up! Yes! I'll continue the watch. Scared? I've gotten the hang of it now. It's a little stormy. Sheeta, get the rope out of my bag. Tie us together with it. Okay. The barometer is falling fast, Mama. A storm. What rotten luck. How long until sunrise? One hour! It's dawn! Pazu, that's strange. The sun is rising on that side. I see! We must be going north, not east! Bridge!  We're going north, you say?! The compass is pointing east! The wind's changed. We're off course! Look...there! What's the matter...the Goliath? The clouds. They're huge. The clouds? They're coming this way! It's a sky castle... THAT'S a low pressure center! The ship won't stand the wind. Full power! Due north! It's coming closer! All right! We're trying! The rudder won't move! Always the damn power! What's wrong? Dora! The engine'll burn up! I don't want any complaints! Just do it! Get out of the clouds! Sheeta, it's the ocean! The Dragon's Nest! This...is the Dragon's Nest?! The wind is blowing in the wrong direction, just like father said. It's a wall of wind! Mama, we can't get out! We're being sucked in. The wind just won't quit! Bridge! Laputa is in there! What? Father saw Laputa in the Dragon's Nest! You're crazy! If we go in, we'll be torn apart! Over there! Now, of all times...! Let's go, Auntie! It's the way Father took, and he came back! ALL RIGHT! Let's go... into the Dragon's Nest! Yeah! We did it! Our ship is in danger, too. We must retreat. No! Carry on. The light always indicates the center of the whirling clouds. Laputa is inside the storm. Steady as she goes. There must be an entrance. Hang on, Sheeta! Sheeta! Are you okay? Look... Laputa... Sorry! Wait; it's still pretty tightly knotted. My hands are shaking. There are birds here. What do you suppose happened to everyone? It's coming to meet you, Sheeta. But I don't have the Levistone. A knife will free us. What are you doing!? Wait! Please, don't break that. We can't go back without it. It's a Hitaki nest! It came because of this? Oh, good...the eggs aren't broken. Not afraid, are they? Let's follow it. Do you know the words?  Don't worry about that! It's a city! We must be inside the buildings. Sheeta, the sky... It looked like stone walls from the outside. But, if their science was so advanced, why...? It's a tomb, isn't it? Forgotten writing... Did you do this? It's not the same robot as before! It must be a gardening robot. There weren't any people... Who knows how long it's been standing guard here. You offered flowers before the tomb? Thank you. You're all alone? Aren't there any other robots here? Doesn't look lonely at all, does it... It has friends. Cares for the Hitaki nests, too. It won't die. This way! The floor has crumbled. The Tiger Moth made it. Auntie and the others are probably okay. Sheeta...over there! Everyone was caught! They've tied them up. Can't we rescue them? Let's go! We've opened a way into the city. Look at this... there's a mountain of treasure inside! Wow. Do you like this? Want it? You'll all get enough...rope that is! Did you notify our country of the discovery of Laputa? I'll do it now. Try to set up a difficult code. HEY, NO STEALING! Those fools are just blind enough. Amazing, these roots... Sheeta, you can climb trees, right? Let's go. What they're doing is terrible... If they go to the upper gardens... Sheeta, we've got to get the Levistone back. Only that will protect this place from those thieves. Why have the clouds cleared? If it hadn't been like this, they wouldn't have been able to land. The effect of my spell... This must be what Muska meant about 'the seal being broken'. This castle is awakened, because the holder of the Levistone approached, riding on the storm. If we don't act, Muska will become king... and, after the plunder, terrible things will start to happen. But how can I get the Levistone back?  Those words... Those words? Impossible...but... We'll go around from below. I'll jump first. It's around here. Dear God... This is it! It's that brat! Damn! Don't shoot. I'll catch her! Well, well...a queen. Captain, what's going on? The rest of the pirates. One of them is hiding at your feet. Yes sir! Find him! Hold it! Get me a hand grenade! It's Pazu. What? It's not what you think! Guards, fall in! Hurry! Auntie! They have Sheeta. I'm going to rescue her. After I cut the ropes, get out of here. Get far away! Hey, wait! Take these. Thanks. That boy will go far. What?! Muska broke all the radios? Yes, sir. We caught his men hiding inside the ship. Many of the bridge crew are seriously wounded. The Captain is inside the lower hemisphere. Some of the men saw him go in. Traitor! He's finally showing his true colors. Gather the troops. This is a spy hunt! Gather all squads! Hurry up, squad 3. Muska and his men are to be shot on sight. Find the entrance! Captain, what in the world is this place? The nerve center of Laputa. The castle and treasure above are just rubbish. The science of Laputa is completely stored in here. You will wait here. Captain! Beyond here, none but the royal family may enter. It's a sanctuary. What's this? Tree roots, this deep? One phrase, and it will all be reduced to ashes. Come on...this way. Here it is! Here, too? Found it! Look at this huge Levistone! This is the source of Laputa's power. Excellent. For 700 years it has been waiting for the return of the king. 700 years? Your clan forgot, didn't it? It's the black stone! Just like in the legend! I can read it! I can read it! Who in the world are you? I also have an old, secret name, Lucita. My name is Romuskaalo Ul Laputa.  Your clan and mine were originally one royal family. But when we returned to the earth, it divided into two. Not a crack. It's not ordinary stone. Use all the bombs we've got! Your Excellency, you cannot get in like that. Muska, where are you? Well...what are you waiting for? Do come inside, your Excellency. Yes. Follow me! Follow His Excellency! Wh...what is this place? Muska...come out! Be silent. What kind of trick is this? Be quiet. You are before the King of Laputa. Are you mad? Today, we celebrate the rebirth of a monarchy. The rebirth of a global empire under one king. Let me show you gentlemen the power of Laputa. It is the heavenly fire that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah in the Old Testament, and the arrows of heaven which took Ramayana, Indora, and Atlantis. The whole world will bow to Laputa again! Excellent, Muska...you're a hero. Now here is your reward. The look on your face! Run, everybody! Die! Those fools! It's full of them... Everybody...RUN! Check the flapters! Mama, let's fly! Hurry, let's get away! Be quiet. Don't raise your voices. Why are those two waiting behind? They'll end up falling. I hope you don't anger me again... ...because it looks like we'll be spending some time together. I do hope they're not trying to get away. They really intend to fight me. Robots. Excellent! Don't you think that this is a great show? Look! The people - they look like garbage. What are you doing? Give it back. Be a good girl. Come on. Please...open up! Where do you think you're going? Open up! Sheeta! I'm coming through! Get down! Hurry, take this! Muska's here! Throw it in the ocean. That stone you have is important. I'll trade the girl's life for it. Get up! The game is over. The old throne room isn't very splendid, is it?  Come here! You say this is the throne room? This is our grave. Our country was destroyed, and a king like you survived. How tragic! I won't give you the stone. You can't leave here without killing me. Why was Laputa destroyed? I know perfectly well. There's a song in the valley of Gondoa. Let our souls fall to the earth; Live as one with the winds. Pass the winter along with the seeds, and sing together with birds for spring. No matter how many weapons you have, or how many poor robots you use, you cannot live, parted from the earth. Laputa will not be destroyed. However many times, it will be reborn. The power of Laputa is the dream of the human race. Your ears will be next. On your knees! Beg for your life! Get the stone back from the brat! Wait! I hid the stone. If you shoot her, I won't return it. Pazu...stay away; it's no use. He's going to kill us, no matter what. Brat...the girl's life for the stone. Tell me where it is. Or, are you just going to scare me with that cannon? I want to talk with Sheeta - alone. It's no use...throw the stone away and run! I'll give you three minutes. Sheeta...calm down. Listen closely. Tell me those words. I'll say them, too. The stone is in my left hand. I've freed Auntie and the others. Time's up! Let's hear your answer. Ba lusu! My eyes...my eyes! My eyes! Mama, it's collapsing! It can't be helped...launch! Hurry! Mama, look! The bottom is falling off! Sheeta was a good girl. She used the words of destruction... Those children protected Laputa from those idiots. The collapse has stopped! It's the Levistone! What luck! It's going up. The tree! It may have them! Follow it! The tree roots saved us. We'll break the wire. Let's go. What are you doing?  We're supposed to be going up! We can't like this! It's Sheeta! They're alive. It's the apprentice. Auntie! Safe and alive, aren't you? Everyone's okay! Everyone's okay except for my poor, tattered ship. Don't be so sentimental. You can build another ship. Poor thing... what a cruel way to get a haircut... Auntie...ouch! Oh, sorry. Isn't it terrible? Worrying so, while full of these! At any rate, we worried in our spare time... # The reason the horizon shines # ano chiheisen kagayaku no wa # is that somewhere it's hiding you. # dokoka ni kimi o kakushite iru kara # The reason I long for the many lights # takusan no hi ga natsukashii no wa # is that you are there in one of them. # ano doreka hitotsu ni kimi ga iru kara # So, I set out, with a slice of bread, # saa dekake you hitokire no PAN # a knife, a lamp, stuffed in a bag. # NAIFU RAMPU kaban ni tsumekonde # Father left me his burning desire. # tou-san ga nokoshita atsui omoi # Mother gave me her eyes. # kaa-san ga kureta ano manazashi # The earth turns, hiding you. # chikyuu wa mawaru kimi o kakushite # Shining eyes, twinkling lights. # kagayaku hitomi kirameku tomoshibi # The earth turns, carrying you, # chikyuu wa mawaru kimi o nosete # carrying us both who'll surely meet. # itsuka kitto deau bokura o nosete # Father left me his burning desire. # tou-san ga nokoshita atsui omoi # Mother gave me her eyes. # kaa-san ga kureta ano manazashi # The earth turns, hiding you. # chikyuu wa mawaru kimi o kakushite # Shining eyes, twinkling lights. # kagayaku hitomi kirameku tomoshibi # The earth turns, carrying you, # chikyuu wa mawaru kimi o nosete # carrying us both who'll surely meet. # itsuka kitto deau bokura o nosete \"],\n",
       " 'The Wind Rises': ['Jiro, here it is.  Would it be alright if I borrow it?  It\\'s not Japanese. That\\'s okay. I have a dictionary.  Alright then, give it a try. Thank you.  Knock it off. Stay out of it, Jiro!  Go home! Now!  Jiro...  He\\'s half your size, Katayama.  Ah...you look quite the hero.  No, I just slipped and fell.  Fighting is never justified. Yes, mother.  Alright. now you can go have your snack.  Thanks.  Jiro, you\\'re home!  Welcome home. Oh, Jiro , now we can pick some bamboo grass.  Jiro!  Wait, where are you going?  You promised to pick bamboo grass today.  I got homework.  What kind of homework is that?  It\\'s an English magazine.  Oh, look at that stupid moustache.  He\\'s a very famous Italian aircraft designer.  His name is Caproni. Wow, it says he\\'s a count.  What happened? Your face is scratched. Leave it alone, Kayo!  You should put iodine on it. I\\'ll do it for you.  Would you cut it out!  What are you doing up here?  You\\'re not suppose to be up here.  Where are your glasses?  I heard you can fix your eyesight by focusing very intently on the stars.  Mom will be mad if you\\'re not in your bed. I see a shooting star!  Oh, there\\'s another one.  Ah, they\\'re pretty. Oh, look at that one!  Wow, there\\'s so many of them.  I\\'m a Japanese boy.  I\\'m dreaming. I think this is my dream.  This is my dream, you know.  I think it\\'s mine too.  Your dream?  Listen, Japanese boy. So you think we are sharing this dream?  I hope so.  You\\'re Count Caproni, aren\\'t you? I\\'ve been reading all about you.  Interesting. Yes, this is a dream. This world is a dream.  Welcome to my kingdom.  I\\'m honored.  Look at them.  They will bomb an enemy city. Most of them will never return.  Well, it\\'ll all be over very soon.  Come on up, Japanese boy.  This is my true dream. When the war is over, I\\'ll build this.  What do you think? Magnificent, isn\\'t she?  Let\\'s take off.  Instead of bombs, she\\'ll carry passengers.  I find dreams are a good way to see my designs. I can go anywhere.  Come on, walk along the spar, Japanese boy.  Look at that.  She\\'s beautiful, yes? Yes, incredible.  She\\'ll carry a hundred people across the Atlantic.  Mr. Caproni, may I ask you a question?  I know I can\\'t be a pilot because of my eyesight.  If I\\'m not a pilot, can I still design airplanes?  Japanese boy, I\\'ve been around planes all my life. You know how many I\\'ve flown? None! Not any one!  Many can fly a plane but I design them.  I create airplanes and so can you. An aeronautical engineer!  Yes!  But remember this, Japanese boy.  Airplanes are not tools for war. They are not for making money.  Airplanes are beautiful dreams.  Engineers turn dreams into reality.  Yes!  Arrivederci. We\\'ll meet again.  Jiro, you were talking in your sleep.  You were smiling. You must be having the most wonderful dream, Jiro.  Mother, I\\'m going to be an aeronautical engineer.  Oh, that does sound like a good dream.  (sigh) He told me that airplanes are beautiful dreams.  So I\\'m going to make beautiful airplanes.  Excuse me Miss, please, take my seat.  Pardon me, sir.  I insist.  (French) The wind feels wonderful.  Miss, you\\'ll lose your hat.  I got it.  Miss! Miss! Hold on!  Are you all right?  Safe!  Nice catch.  You speak French?  \"Le vent se lève.\" It\\'s a French poem.  \"Il faut tenter de vivre.\"  \"Le vent se lève. Il faut tenter de vivre.\"  \"The wind is rising. We must try to live.\"  Earthquake.  Get away! The boiler\\'s going to blow!  What\\'s wrong? Her leg.  Here, let me see.  Ah...  Be brave, Kinu.  It\\'s broken. She won\\'t be able to walk.  Miss, the boiler. Please save yourself, go!  That\\'s nonsense.  Nothing\\'s going to explode.  We need to brace her leg.  This will hurt a little, relax.  She can\\'t walk on this. Where do you live?  In Ueno. Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll get you there.  Fire. Let\\'s go.  What about your luggage? It\\'s not important.  I\\'m so sorry.  You alright? Okay.  Better hurry.  Here, my mother made me this shirt. You must be thirsty.  Don\\'t worry, it\\'s clean.  The well\\'s almost dry... and for you?  Please.  The fire hasn\\'t reached Ueno and I\\'m heading for the university. So, I can take you there.  And help bring someone, from my house.  Then we should get going, now.  Kinu, look after my suitcase. Okay.  We\\'ll bring someone to get you home. I promise.  Stay strong. Okay. I will.  Thank you very much for helping us. Take care of her.  But wait, at least tell us your name.  What a great guy. Who was he, Kinu?  Well, it isn\\'t Jiro. You picked a lovely day to come back.  How bad is it, Honjo?  Bad enough. The whole east side is burning.  We grabbed everything we could carry out of the library.  Got a smoke?  A flying door? Don\\'t see that everyday. We\\'ll never gonna stop the fire now.  Tokyo\\'s finished.  It\\'s as beautiful as it was in the dream. I can\\'t really believe he built it.  Cut! Cut! Cut!  Damn wind\\'s picking up. We need to hurry.  What do you think, Japanese boy? Is the wind still rising?  Yes, it\\'s a gale.  Well then, you must live. \"Le vent se lève.\"  \"II faut tenter de vivre.\"  Jiro, let\\'s eat.  Look, even the new buildings are old-fashioned.  If the streets are a little wider.  So? The airplanes are still old.  Welcome!  Oh look, Mackerel again?  Yeah, it\\'s always good.  Always. Always the same lunch, always the same Mackerel.  Kina, can you help me? Coming up!  Meanwhile, other countries are building metal planes.  We\\'re 10 years behind and you\\'re still stuck with Mackerel.  What is that?  Beautiful, isn\\'t it?  Look at that wonderful curve.  Only you would get a thrill from fish bones.  Come on, finish up. I need a coffee.  What on earth is Jiro working so hard on?  Fish bones.  Is Mr. Horikoshi back from lunch?  Jiro!  Honjo, listen to this.  The NACA has a standard wingcross section just like the curve of this fish bone.  Maybe the Americans eat mackerel too.  Jiro, you got a visitor.  Yes? A young lady came by and brought this package for you, Mr. Horikoshi.  You were out, so she left it with me.  I see. Thank you very much.  Ah, is that a present from your girlfriend, Jiro?  Can it, freshman, and give me a smoke.  Jiro! Let him go.  Oh, Mr. Horikoshi. Yes, Mam?  You\\'ve a guest waiting for you upstairs. It\\'s a young lady.  Huh, young lady?  Hello? Finally, where were you?  Kayo, I\\'m sorry.  Completely forgot.  I\\'m not surprise!  Where\\'s mother? At uncle\\'s.  Is she staying there? Just for a night.  Kayo, you\\'ve gotten so tall and very pretty too.  You\\'re so insensitive. I\\'m still mad at you \\'cause you never come home!  Oh, the sun is already down. I\\'m going to be late.  I\\'ll tell them it\\'s my fault. Don\\'t worry. We\\'ll take the penny steamer.  I think she must really like you.  I don\\'t know, it\\'s been over two years.  Didn\\'t you ever try to see her again?  I did. I went back after the fire was out.  Her house has burnt down. That\\'s terrible.  Here, let\\'s catch this one.  Are you cold, Kayo?  I\\'m fine. I didn\\'t think Tokyo would recover so quickly.  Jiro, maybe I can stay here with you?  Father won\\'t let me live here by myself.  Well, I might be at Nagoya by the time you come.  With an airplane company? I hope so.  Men have it so good.  Why can\\'t I live in Tokyo and go to medical school?  Medical school? You should, I think you make a great doctor.  I think so too.  When I\\'m home for New Years, I\\'ll talk to father about it.  Oh, thank you.  Hey, Jiro!  Heavy? Yep.  Glad you made it. Me too.  We are just getting started. We certainly are.  Well, they are probably heading for the city to look for work.  There are dozens of of them.  And there will be hundreds more.  Ah, looks like we lost another bank. Tough time is coming, Hachi.  It\\'s awful. I\\'m so sad.  There were rumors.  The economy\\'s in the tank. I hate to break to you Jiro but so is our new employer.  Mitsubishi Internal Combustion Engine CO.  You know the pressure we are under. We needed you here over a month ago.  But sir, I was told I could start anytime in April.  Then you should\\'ve been here in March! Yes, sir.  I got a very important assignment for you. Yes, sir.  It\\'s the design for the wing strut fitting and by the way, it\\'s already late! Yes, sir.  I need the plan in the shop as soon as possible. Do what you have to do. Yes, sir.  Here.  Let\\'s get you ? specification. Follow me.  This will be your desk.  It\\'s imported, nobody likes it. Maybe you will. Yes, sir.  Work goes here, hat goes there. Yes, sir.  Listen up! This is the new engineer on the Falcon Project.  It\\'s that genius we\\'ve been hearing all about.  Name? Genius.  Jiro Horikoshi. I\\'m very happy to be here.  Get to work. Yes, sir.  And the rest of you, get back to work!  Jiro, Jiro.  Let\\'s eat.  Let\\'s go see the assembly floor. Could we maybe have lunch first?  Maybe Kurokawa simply hates you. Why else would he have you design that strut on your first day.  Two, please.  Excuse me. Could we ask a slight favor?  Wow, it\\'s really coming along.  Thank you again for making time for us on your break.  No problem at all. You young engineers should visit here more often.  Honjo, look, the strut has already been installed.  I knew it.  Kurokawa is obviously just hazing you, unless his fitting is better than yours...  Mr. Kurokawa is always tough on new employees.  Honjo, come up here and take a look.  Something is not right.  What do you think? It looks all right to me .  No, this isn\\'t good. It got the same problem with my design.  Then it must be bad.  Foreman, lunch\\'s over. What\\'s going on?  Quiet! They are working.  I love it! Airplanes are fascinating!  Yea, fascinating but we\\'re late.  Young man.  This is our boss, Mr. Hattori.  This is his first assignment?  Strut fitting for the Falcon Project, sir.  Not what I\\'ve expected. What am I looking at here?  Sir, the steel leaf-spring will ease the stress from the wing.  This wire expands and contracts, absorbing the forces that act on the wing.  I have it running thru\\' the strut and anchoring it on the fuselage.  That means that we would have to entirely re-design the length of the wing!  You\\'re right. I\\'ll run the calculations tonight, sir.  You\\'re wasting your time. Where\\'s the assignment that I gave to you this morning?  Right here, sir. I finished it.  Well done. What do you think, Kurokawa?  It\\'s perfect.  Turn in your work as soon as you\\'re done! Yes, sir.  What a day, I\\'m heading out. Me too.  Wild guess, you already finished Kurokawa\\'s homework?  Just about.  What\\'s the oxen for?  Oh, they haul the prototypes to the field.  Takes them 2 days to drag it out there. You believe that? That\\'s how backward we are.  I don\\'t know. I like them.  Here she comes.  Almost here!  Almost here!  Damn it!  Tell me you got it? 13.3 seconds. 146 knots.  Blast. She needs more horse power.  She deserves better.  Hey, Kurokawa! Yes, sir?  A word with the clients.  Gentlemen? Well done.  Yea, your Falcon is one hell of a plane! And I bet Mitsubishi couldn\\'t do it. Now I\\'m buying drinks!  Power dive. He\\'s trying to break 200 knots.  The chute! Go get him!  Mr. Kurokawa, let\\'s investigate what happened when the weather clears. It would be easier.  How\\'s the pilot? He\\'s okay.  That\\'s good.  Let\\'s go, Mr. Kurokawa. We\\'ll re-group, for Falcon Two.  Here you\\'ll be straight with me. Do you think the strut fitting failed?  No. I think the problem here is much deeper and more complicated than we thought.  I\\'ll never forget what I saw today.  It\\'s like an endless road is opened up before my eyes.  There won\\'t be a Falcon Two.  The Army has decided to go with the competing design.  Today was our last shot to change their minds.  We\\'ll have to shift course. We\\'re gonna to design and build the heavy bomber, with help from the Germans.  You\\'re going to Germany to study Junker\\'s design. I recommended you.  Still open? Ah, welcome back.  Your usual?  Yea, but 2 slices this time. Coming up.  Here you go.  Who looks after them?  Well, their parents work late. They wait there every night.  I feel bad closing the place up.  I see. Well, thanks.  See you tomorrow.  Are you hungry? I\\'ve 2 slices of sponge cake.  You can have them. It\\'s okay, I just bought them.  Go ahead, take it.  Come on!  Jiro?  Wake up! I heard they axed the Falcon Project. I need details.  Sponge cake again? How do you stay alive?  What did you expect?  Did you think she was just going to smile and say \"thank you, sir\"  Of course not.  Well, maybe I did.  Well, if you\\'re looking for a mouth to feed, there happen to be plenty of other hungry kids in this neighborhood.  And their parents are probably hungrier. It\\'s shameful. I bet it\\'s gonna get worse before it gets better.  I don\\'t understand why this country is so poor.  Poor Jiro, stuck in his happy dreams. What Japan is paying the Germans, they can feed every single man, woman and child a mountain of sponge cake but if this country wants airplanes, then I\\'m goona make the most of it.  Really? They\\'re sending you too?  They told me today.  That\\'s great.  The fact is this poor country pays us a lot of money to design war planes. Embrace the irony.  I\\'m going to Tokyo tomorrow to get married.  Marry?  To work hard at the office, you need a family at home.  More irony for you. Goodnight.  These tight-fisted Germans aren\\'t letting us see any of Dr.Junker\\'s work.  I don\\'t see any oxen.  Jiro, the airstrip\\'s right next to the plant.  Wow, everything\\'s so big.  It\\'s the G-38. Is this what we\\'re buying?  Yep, to convert to a bomber.  Who\\'s The Army planning to bomb with this one?  America, probably. Not that they could.  This is something.  It\\'s amazing.  Look. Passengers sit in the wings. It would be a shame to put bombs there.  That\\'s the job, pal. This is our chance to get the all-metal technology.  What? They\\'re not letting us in?  Beautiful.  Take your hands off.  You\\'ve been slamming doors on our faces all day.  You Japanese copy everything. All these technology belong to Germany.  Oh, I get it. So you\\'re afraid we\\'ll actually improve it!  Honjo, let me talk to them.  (German) We have a license to your technology.  Therefore we officiallly have a right to be in this hangar examining these airplanes.  I understand you\\'re just doing your job but please understand I\\'m just doing mine.  When I saw Dr.Junkers\\' single engine plane, I had to get a closer look.  I\\'m not a soldier, simply an engineer admiring a fellow engineer\\'s work.  And as soldier, my orders are not to leave you Japanese unattended.  That\\'s Dr. Junkers.  What an engineer.  Dr. Junkers gave you permission to go inside.  So Jiro, what do you think?  There\\'s more vibration than I expected.  Our bosses are kids in a candy store.  Hey, you two should let the Army reps sit here, okay? Yes, sir.  Just one moment, please.  It\\'s fantastic, what a fortress.  Look, you can walk thru\\' the wing.  It\\'s amazing.  It\\'s like being inside a power plant.  Guten tag. We\\'ve permission to be here from Dr. Junkers.  Would you mind telling us a bit about your station.  Here is the engineer\\'s station.  It\\'s such a marvelous aircraft.  Young man, you can\\'t go any further.  We understand, my friend.  Are you seeing this? It\\'s incredible.  A triumph of German industrial technology.  Junkers let us in, the Germans shut us out! These specs are useless!  Jiro, give me a cigarette.  Jiro!  Give me a smoke.  We\\'re out.  It\\'s cold outside but this room is quite cozy.  You know that Junkers make these radiators too?  Funny, they look just like his planes with such strong paralel lines.  Hmm...  Okay, I get it. German\\'s technology is so superior that they can put wings on anything and fly it, including their damn radiators. Jiro, would you just give it a rest, please.  We can\\'t learn anything from these government specs.  They\\'re nothing but a bunch of pretty numbers.  \"This technology belongs to Germany.\"  Honjô, maybe we don\\'t need their technology afterall.  Wood and canvas could be just as good as metal.  Jiro, we cannot be stuck in the past forever. We\\'re already 20 years behind!  Let\\'s get some air.  My brain is going to explode.  It\\'s as if we were a hare chasing a tortoise with a 20-year lead.  But in our little story, the hare doesn\\'t sleep.  We can close the gap but how could we beat it?  We\\'re too far behind. We\\'ll always be chasing it.  But what other choice do we have? Keep running and catch up someday?  I wonder if there\\'s a different way to run.  What is it?  Schubert\\'s \"Winter Journey\".  Well, that\\'s perfect for us. Masterpiece of misery memoir.  What was that? Secret Police. We saw them in the hangar.  Jiro?  Jiro, I\\'m done. The bath is yours.  Dead to the world... because he thinks he\\'s shouldering the future of Japanese aviation.  There\\'s a telegram from headquarters.  Come in. No need.  Some of us will be returning to Japan right away. You\\'re staying here in Germany.  Jiro will continue west and return to Japan.  West? They want him to see the world.  Alone?  Mr. Caproni.  Is the wind still rising?  Yes sir, it sure is.  Then it\\'s a perfect time to embark on my final flight. Join me.  Wait, you\\'re retiring?  It\\'s a pretty big jump.  Come on, jump!  Why are you sitting there? Let\\'s go!.  There\\'s a hatch underneath the fuselage.  Hurry up! Yes, sir.  Let him through, girls.  Up here!  Come in! Yeh! Yeh!  These are all my workers and their families. Practically the whole village.  I thought we take a little journey before we deliver this bomber to the government.  What do you think? Incredible!  It\\'s like a building out of ancient Rome.  This plane is too big to be used for fighting but the military has a weakness for big things.  Japan can never build anything as grand and as beautiful as this. The country is too poor and backward Inspiration is more important than scale.  Inspiration unlocks the future. Technology eventually catches up.  That\\'s my family.  We Italians are very poor as well. Too many mouths to feed.  Hey, settle down or the bottom will fall out.  Come on.  Be careful. This may be a dream but you can still lose your head.  Which would you choose, a world with pyramids or without?  What do you mean?  Humanity has always dreamt of flight, but the dream is cursed.  My aircrafts are destined to become tools for slaughter and destruction.  I know.  But still, I chose a world with pyramids in it.  Which world will you choose?  I just want to create beautiful airplanes.  Like that?  Very graceful.  I have a long way to go. I don\\'t even have an engine or a cockpit yet.  Bravo! A beautiful dream.  This is my last design.  Artists are only creative for ten years.  We engineers are no different.  Live your ten years well, Japanese boy.  Jiro, let\\'s go get some coffee.  But I gotta go to a... Cancel it.  This is a very tall order. They\\'re always tall.  How long have you been here, Jiro?  Jiro!  How long have you been here? Five years.  Jiro, we\\'re going to bid for the Navy\\'s carrier base fighter.  We think we\\'re ready to beat the Navy\\'s chief designer.  It\\'s a plum job.  It\\'s a plum job!  What do you think?  Leave it to me, sir.  Good.  I\\'d like Honjo on the team, sir.  Not a good idea.  You\\'d just end up competing. Friendships are always more important.  Relax, finish your coffee.  My check, please. Kurokawa.  We\\'ve got other plans for your friend Honjo.  Damn these Japanese engines!  Damn these short runways.  I brought some clean uniforms.  Oh, thank you very much.  These are clean uniforms.  Yes, we are ready.  Man overboard!  Stop!  Whoa!  (cheering on)  Father!  Bravo! That was a nice catch.  It nearly took you away. Are you all right?  I\\'m fine.  Thank you. I\\'ll make sure that it stays grounded.  Yes, sir.  I feel bad. I wanted to say thank you.  Nice young man. Don\\'t worry.  He\\'s staying at our hotel. You\\'ll have a chance to say thank you.  What is it, dear?  There\\'s something about that man who caught the parasol.  Oh, he seems to be here by himself.  I\\'m very sorry.  Please don\\'t go. I was giving thanks to the spring.  I asked it to bring you here. I asked it to bring you to me.  You haven\\'t changed at all from that day years ago. You look just the same.  We were so grateful for your help after the earthquake.  I wanted to see you again and thank you.  Oh, I remember.  My name is Nahoko Satomi.  I\\'m Jiro Horikoshi.  This umbrella is useless. Are you alright?  Oh, I\\'m fine.  Kinu searched for you for years. Then she found you just before she got married.  She cried with joy after she dropped off your shirt.  You see, you were our knight in shining armor.  Your knight?  You, I think I remember you were on a white horse.  Well, I\\'m not doing much now to keep you dry.  It\\'s okay.  I don\\'t mind at all.  Kinu will be so excited when I tell her.  I found our hero again.  Oh, your painting is ruined.  No, it\\'s not. I\\'ll always remember this day when I look at it.  Well, look, it\\'s clearing up.  It\\'s like another land!  Oh, Jiro, look!  I almost forgot what rainbows look like.  Life is wonderful, isn\\'t it?  Oh, we should go. My father\\'s probably worried sick.  There he is.  Father!  Come with me. I would really love to introduce you. Of course.  You\\'re soaking wet.  No, no, I\\'m fine. I was just with Mr. Horikoshi, he saved me again.  Jiro Horikoshi.  I\\'m Satomi. It\\'s so very good to meet you, Mr. Horikoshi.  May I sit here?  Certainly.  German tobacco. I\\'ve been saving it. Last one.  I understand. Japanese cigarette always taste like home to me.  You must\\'ve visited Germany, yes? Perhaps to Dessau?  Oh, you must be Sherlock Holmes.  You read magazines.  German magazines about airplanes. All Japanese engineers visit Dessau. It\\'s elementary. my dear Watson.  You cracked the case.  Dr. Junkers is in trouble. In trouble?  He fights the hand that feeds him and he will lose.  He fights Mr. Hitler\\'s government?  The Nazis are a gang of hoodlums.  This is quite a good place.  No mosquitoes. Not too hot. Good watercress.  A good place to forget bad things. Isn\\'t that right?  Cigarette? I\\'m afraid they\\'re Japanese.  Thank you.  It is a nice night. \"Hier ist der Zauberberg.\"  \"The Magic Mountain\" by Thomas Mann?  Yes, a good place for forgetting.  Make a war in China. Forget it.  Make a puppet state in Manchuria. Forget it.  Quit the League of Nations. Forget it.  Make the world your enemy. Forget it.  Japan will blow up.  Germany will blow up too.  Do you think Germany will go to war again? Yes. They must be stopped.  I\\'m sorry to keep you waiting.  Naoko has a fever.  We\\'ll have to cancel our dinner plans.  Oh, I\\'m sorry to hear that. I hope that she feels better soon.  The doctor will be here soon. I must go.  \"Who has seen the wind?\"  \"Neither I nor you.\"  \"But when the leaves hang trembling, the wind is passing through.\"  Let the wind carry these wings, carry these wings to you.  Jiro?  Naoko!  Be careful!  Nice catch.  Bravo! Bravo!  Well, is your daughter feeling better?  Yes, thank you, much better.  Wonderful.  This is the magic mountain. It cures everyone.  I think you\\'re right.  At the begining, this young man was very gloomy.  Now he is very happy because he\\'s in love.  Yes.  But summer love is seasonal.  You will go down the mountain and forget all about it.  That\\'s not true.  This love of yours, it wouldn\\'t be about my daughter, right?  Yes sir, I love her very much.  And I sincerely hope you\\'ll approve, Mr Satomi.  Well, I don\\'t, uh...  Father!  I would very much like to have your approval too.  Now, that\\'s a beauty.  But Jiro, there\\'s something I need you to understand.  Anything.  My mother died of tuberculosis two years ago.  And now I have it too.  Naoko, I\\'m in love with you. Nothing ever going to stop me.  I\\'ve loved you since the day the wind brought you to me.  Will you please marry me.  Yes.  But I first I\\'m gonna get well. Will you please wait for me?  I\\'ll, even if it\\'s gonna take a hundred years.  Congratulations.  He is a nice young man and your daughter is wonderful.  This is a summer to remember.  If it isn\\'t the long lost Jiro! Honjo!  When did you get back? Two days ago.  Hot, isn\\'t it?  Come, take a look at this.  She\\'s beautiful.  Good clean lines.  They gave me free rein, so I designed something radical.  But it won\\'t mount to anything if she doesn\\'t fly.  Oh, I\\'m sure she\\'ll fly. I feel the wind rising.  Honjo, you\\'ve closed the gap and in one huge step.  My plane was just a tin duckling.  But here\\'s an idea for you.  I thought of it too late to implement on my plane.  It\\'s a way to reduce drag by using flathead screws on all the access hatches and the fueling port. Maintenance will be easy with a hinge on one side.  I think a spring of this diameter should be fine.  Jiro, that\\'s it! What a great idea, as usual.  You should use it.  Thanks pal, but not this time.  I\\'ll keep these but I won\\'t use them before you. Your idea belongs in your next plane.  Thanks, Honjo.  You\\'re welcome. You better hurry up.  Jiro! Where are you?  Mr. Kurokawa. Jiro.  Get back to the office!  Thanks. I\\'m coming!  Come to the house for a drink next time. Sure!  Jiro, you pedal.  The Secret Police are looking for you. Oh, what?  Did you hear me? The fight crime boys.  But why me?  Didn\\'t ask. I told them you were away.  They\\'re just pretending to leave. We won\\'t fall for that.  You work up here today. I\\'ve arranged it.  But why would they possibly be after me? I don\\'t understand.  They\\'ve already arrested some of my friends. None of them understood why.  Enter.  Here\\'s your stuff.  I think we got everything.  I can go back and check.  Nah, just leave it and go. Jiro, the flange is here!  Can\\'t wait to see it!  It\\'s perfect.  Sure is. I wish we had that a year ago.  So, what do you think, Jiro?  Our next plane won\\'t just be a duckling, it\\'ll be a full-grown duck.  A full metal duck.  Mr. Kurokawa, what do you think?  I hope you youngsters appreciate the luxury of extruded aluminum alloy.  That\\'s it, now back to work!  Alright, the coast looks clear. Okay, Jiro.  You should keep a low profile for a few days, just in case.  We\\'ll try to smooth things over.  I\\'ll put you up at my house.  Can we stop at my apartment first? I\\'ve to check my mail.  Is it sensitive?  Yes, it\\'s very sensitive.  The police will be opening all your mail.  It\\'s from my fiancée.  This is outrageous. These things shouldn\\'t happen in a modern country.  You\\'re engaged?  You\\'re a human after all.  I thought you would marry an airplane!  I don\\'t find that very funny!  Of course it\\'s not funny. The police are waiting for you at your apartment.  If they want to read your love letters, let them!  Jiro, we need you to focus on the fighter project.  That\\'s why we sent you away to rest after the crash. The company will do everything to protect you.  If you keep your mind in your work.  I can\\'t bear being apart from you.  Why do you suppose the police are looking for Mr. Castorp? He left so suddenly.  I pray everyday that he managed to leave Japan safely.  Jiro, you\\'ve a telephone call.  The telephone is over there. Thank you, Mrs. Kurokawa.  Hello? Jiro? It\\'s me. You have a telegram.  Yes?  Your landlord received it two days ago. We just brought it in here now.  Would you please read it to me?  Now? Yes  \"Nahoko...has had a lung...heh, heh... hemorrhage. Satomi.\"  Jiro? Are you still there?  Thank you. I\\'ve to go now.  Jiro, wait!  What is it?  Mrs. Kurokawa, please, I need to know the quickest way to get to Tokyo!  Tokyo? Today?  Yes, it\\'s an emergency. I have to be there as soon as possible.  Alright.  If you take the noon bus, then you\\'ll just be able to catch the express.  I\\'ll send someone to hold the bus for you. Go get your things. Thank you.  Jiya!  Darling!  I\\'m sorry I wasn\\'t here sooner.  You\\'ll catch it.  You\\'re beautiful.  I love you.  Jiro? Through the garden?  Come in, father.  Father, look who\\'s here? Jiro.  He came all the way from Nagoya but can\\'t stay for long.  I\\'ll be sure to use the front door the next time I come Hah, the garden, it\\'s faster.  Okay, garden it is.  Take care, my darling.  Sleep well.  Goodnight, sir.  I\\'ll see you out.  You better hurry if you gonna catch the last train.  I wish I could look after her, Mr. Satomi. She seems so tired.  The last thing Naoko wants is to be a burden to you.  You better go.  Naoko?  Are you alright?  I\\'m going to the sanatorium in the mountain, the one the doctor recommended.  Why? It\\'s so far and I don\\'t want you to be alone.  Because I want to get better, father.  I want to have a life with Jiro.  Just made it. The whole board is waiting.  So, are you ready?  Gentleman, I\\'ll do my best.  Now you\\'ll see the Navy. They\\'re the client.  Gentleman, I\\'ll do my best.  You weren\\'t even listening. Nope.  So I gave up on that idea.  Very well, they\\'re late. Jiro\\'s in the middle of a review with the design team.  I wanted this design to use the latest aeronautical advances.  Take a look. Retractable undercarriage!  It\\'s built to reach 270 knots.  270 knots? That\\'s 500 kilometers per hour!  But the Navy only asked for 220 knots.  220 will be obselete by next week.  The wing load is 120 kilos per square meter.  Minimal drag will be the key. I pushed the design to the limit of technology, with split flaps and slats on the leading edges.  We can do it!  When do we start?  But the weight becomes the big problem.  One solution would be, we could leave out the guns.  So, I decided to put this design back on the shelf.  This is refreshing, delightful.  He nearly had it.  But we\\'re not giving up because our engines are underpowered. We\\'ll build a light, strong air frame.  We\\'ll cut every ounce of excess weight and minimize drag with a smooth skin.  We\\'re going to build an all-metal fighter, like nothing the world has ever seen!  I have a question!  Mr. Hirayama, please.  This is Mr. Hirayama, he\\'s our production engineer.  Thank you, sir.  He\\'s going to tell us about the new rivets that he\\'s developing.  I believe it\\'s technically possible to match the strength of conventional rivets with rivets that are flushed.  What\\'s he talking about?  A new way to cut drag.  We\\'re going to skin the entire plane with flushed rivets to produce a nimble, fast aircraft.  Question! I have a question!  I must say, that was interesting.  It was inspiring.  Miss Satomi, today\\'s letter.  Thank you.  Chief, you\\'ve a phone call.  I\\'ll have to call him back. I think it\\'s an emergency.  Hello, Mr. Satomi. Good to hear from you, sir.  Yes, yes, what?  Jiro! I\\'m here now.  Jiro! I\\'m here.  You alright, my love? Can you walk?  Come.  I\\'ve to go back. I just needed to see you.  No, don\\'t go back.  We should be together.  Oh, you must be Naoko. Please to meet you.  I\\'m so glad you\\'re here. Jiro.  Mr. Kurokawa, we\\'ve a request.  We\\'ve plenty of room, dear.  I know we\\'ve the room, that\\'s not the problem. I simply can\\'t approve an unmarried couple living under this roof.  Then we\\'ll marry tonight.  Mr. Kurokawa, Mrs. Kurokawa, will you please be our witnesses.  What? Tonight?  Of course we\\'ll, dear.  Naoko travelled all this way, it\\'s the least we can do.  My doctors know about this and my father has given his blessing.  Please, help us.  The bride and I have a lot of work to do, and so do you.  Come, Naoko.  Oh, don\\'t mind him, he\\'s always like that.  If you care about her at all, Jiro, you\\'ll send her back on the morning train.  I\\'ll have to give up the fighter project, Mr. Kurokawa, because I would go with her.  Is that your heart or your ego talking?  Naoko doesn\\'t have much time. We\\'ve made our decision.  I see.  All right. So I guess it\\'s on with wedding!  Here they come.  She\\'s coming!  Hear me! I bring to you a lovely maiden who has come from the mountain to be with her beloved. She has given up everything for him. What say you?  Hear me! The man I present is an insensitive charcoal head without even a home to call his own. but if that\\'s what she wants, she can come in.  And then, they shall exchange the sacred vows.  You\\'re beautiful.  Mr. Kurokawa, Mrs. Kurokawa.  All Jiro and I\\'ve in this world is each other, I cannot thank you enough for your kindness.  We will never forget our debt to you.  Nonsense, there\\'s absolutely no debt to repay. We\\'re both so happy that you\\'ve found each other.  Aren\\'t we, dear?  Um...hmm, you both are very, very brave!  You must be exhausted.  I feel like I\\'m in a wonderful dream. Feel like the room is spinning.  You should try to get some rest.  Come here.  Are you sure?  Come here.  Kayo! You\\'re going to tell me you completely forgotten I was coming?  Yes, I completely forgot you were coming.  You\\'re so insensitive.  Congratulations on finishing medical school.  Congratulations on your marriage to Naoko.  I\\'ve come to thank Mr. and Mrs. Kurokawa on behalf of the entire family.  Are they still up?  They\\'ve gone to bed.  So, you\\'ve met Naoko? Yes.  Jiro, what\\'re you going to do? She\\'s alone in that room all day.  You won\\'t know it because you come home so late!  Do you know she puts rouge on her cheek so that you won\\'t worry?  Naoko condition is much worse than you think, Jiro. I know because at school I watch these people...  She\\'s my sister now. I really like her.  How can you do this to her?  Does Naoko really have to stay here?  Yes.  She does because each day together is very precious to us now.  Get some rest. We can talk more in the morning. I\\'m glad you\\'re here.  I\\'m home.  I must have dozed off. Go back to sleep.  Thank you. Did you see your sister? Yes.  I like her a lot.  So confident and strong. She has got such a bright future ahead of her.  I told her I wanted her to be my doctor.  She brought me a gift from your mother, this nightgown and robe.  See, she made it for me.  Is that too bright?  No, it\\'s fine.  I have to finish the design by tomorrow.  Your Mackerel bones?  You remembered.  I think I may have a way to make it a bit lighter.  Come a little closer.  Give me your hand.  This is nice. I really like looking at you while you\\'re working, Jiro.  On a contest for one-handed slide ruler users, I\\'d win first prize for sure.  Look at that, I can make each rib half an ounce lighter.  You can? That\\'s good.  Thirty ribs, that almost make a pound.  See, I knew it.  You were better when you\\'re holding my hand.  You\\'re right. If only I could leave my hand right here for a test-flight.  You my dear, should get some sleep.  Don\\'t let go. No, I won\\'t let go.  I need a cigarette. Can I let go for a minute?  No, smoke here.  It\\'s not good for you. I don\\'t care.  Hey, Honjo.  Can I take a look?  Sure. I hear good things about your heavy bomber. Ah, it\\'s not bad.  Jiro, she\\'s beautiful.  The infamous flush riveting.  Feels a little rough.  Yea, we\\'re still learning how to do it.  Well, you\\'ll get it. You already left the Germans behind. I\\'m still stuck with them.  This design is classic Jiro, right down to the Mackerel bones.  Jiro, is it alright if I use your flush rivets and that spring-loaded hatch.  Um...hmm, of course.  Skeched a redesign?  Yeah, I wanted to redo the whole thing but they only let me touch the fuselage.  But, what about the wings?  That\\'s what keeps me up at night. The wings still carry all the fuel and I can\\'t shield them because she has to fly over 1,800 miles.  It\\'s already too heavy. We can\\'t even add an ounce of weight.  So without a redesign, Japan\\'s first advance bomber only needs 2 or 3 hits and she will burn like a torch.  And who are they going to bomb with it?  China. Russia. Britain. The Netherlands. America.  Japan will blow up.  We\\'re not arms merchants. We just want to build good aircraft.  That\\'s right.  Good night, pal. Try to get some sleep.  You too.  Boss, I\\'m calling it a day.  Good night, sir.  Good night.  Welcome home.  My plane is finished. Now we\\'ll see how she flies.  Congratulations. You worked so hard.  The oxen are taking her way to the field now.  I\\'ll probably have to spend the next few nights there.  You must be tired, my love.  Just a little.  She will fly beautifully.  Hmm, she will.  I couldn\\'t have done it without you here.  I love you, Jiro.  Naoko...  I\\'m off.  Good luck.  What are you doing up?  I\\'m feeling so much better today, Mrs. Kurokawa. So I thought I\\'ll take a walk.  Be careful, don\\'t tire yourself out. I know.  The room\\'s still a mess but I\\'ll straighten it up when I get back.  All right but remember, Kayo\\'s coming soon to be here for her brother\\'s celebration.  Yes. I\\'ll be back soon.  Please come inside.  Oh, no.  she left us letters! This letter is for me.  Says she\\'s going back to the sanatorium! I\\'ll find her.  No! Let her go.  We shouldn\\'t do anything until after Naoko\\'s train leaves.  She wants him to always remember her as she was.  Wonderful, just look at her, true Japanese fighter.  What about speed? How she do?  The numbers, they\\'re off the charts. We\\'re checking them again.  How fast is she?  240. Two forty?  Fantastic! What a fighter.  Hey, Jiro.  Jiro!  She flies like a dream. Thank you.  So, we meet again, Japanese boy.  Mr. Caproni...  I remember this place. This is where we first met in our kingdom of dreams.  Now it\\'s the land of the dead.  Not quite but in some ways, yes.  But what about your ten years in the sun, did you live them well?  Yes. Things fell apart in the end, though.  That\\'s what happen when you lose a war.  There\\'s your fighter.  Truly, truly a masterful design.  Not a single one returned.  There was nothing to return to.  Airplanes are beautiful curse of dreams, waiting for the sky to swallow them up.  Someone is waiting for you.  Naoko...  She\\'s been waiting here for a long time.  You must live, darling.  You must live...  She was beautiful, like the wind.  Thank you. Thank you.  You must live.  But now, shall we drop by my house? I\\'ve some very excellent wine.'],\n",
       " 'Captain America Civil War': ['1 Longing Rusted Seventeen Daybreak Furnace Nine Benign Homecoming One Freight car Good morning, Soldier. Ready to comply. I have a mission for you. Sanction and extract. No witnesses. Well done Soldier. All right, what do you see? Standard beat cops. Small station. Quiet street. It\\'s a good target. There\\'s an ATM on the south corner, which means? Cameras. Both cross streets are one-way. So, compromised escape routes. Means our guy doesn\\'t care about being seen. He isn\\'t afraid to make a mess on the way out. You see that Range Rover halfway up the block? Yeah, the red one? It\\'s cute. It\\'s also bulletproof, which means private security... which means more guns, which means more headaches for somebody. Probably us. You guys know I can move things with my mind, right? Looking over your shoulder needs to become second nature. Anybody ever tell you you\\'re a little paranoid? Not to my face. Why? Did you hear something? Eyes on target, folks. This is the best lead we\\'ve had on Rumlow in six months. I don\\'t want to lose him. If he sees us coming, that won\\'t be a problem. He kind of hates us. Sam... see that garbage truck? Tag it. Give me X-ray. That truck\\'s loaded for max weight. And the driver\\'s armed. It\\'s a battering ram. - Go now. - What? He\\'s not hitting the police. Body armour, AR-15s. I make seven hostiles. I make five. Sam. Four. Rumlow\\'s on the third floor. Wanda, just like we practised. What about the gas? Get it out. Pack it up. He\\'s here. Rumlow has a biological weapon. I\\'m on it. I don\\'t work like that no more. Fire in the hole. No! Sam. He\\'s in an AFV heading north. Take this to the airstrip. We\\'re not gonna outrun them. Lose the truck. Where are you going to meet us? I\\'m not. I\\'ve got four, they\\'re splitting up. I got the two on the left. They ditched their gear. It\\'s a shell game now. One of them has the payload. There you are, you son of a bitch. I\\'ve been waiting for this. He doesn\\'t have it. I\\'m empty! Out of the way! Drop it. Or I\\'ll drop this. - Drop it! - He\\'ll do it! Payload secure. Thanks, Sam. Don\\'t thank me. I\\'m not thanking that thing. His name is Redwing. I\\'m still not thanking it. He\\'s cute. Go ahead, pet him. Come on! This is for dropping a building on my face. Ahh! I think I look pretty good, all things considered. Who\\'s your buyer? You know, he knew you. Your pal, your buddy, your Bucky. What did you say? He remembered you. I was there. He got all weepy about it. Till they put his brain back in a blender. He wanted you to know something. He said to me... \"Please tell Rogers. \"When you gotta go... \"you gotta go.\" And you\\'re coming with me. Oh, my... Sam... we need Fire and Rescue on the south side of the building. We gotta get up there. Try to remember the kind of September When grass was green Wake up, dear, and say goodbye to your father. Who\\'s the homeless person on the couch? This is why I love coming home for Christmas... right before you leave town. Be nice, dear, he\\'s been studying abroad. Really? Which broad? What\\'s her name? Candice. Do me a favour? Try not to burn the house down before Monday. Okay, so it\\'s Monday. That is good to know, I will plan my toga party accordingly. Where you going? Your father\\'s flying us to the Bahamas for a little getaway. We might have to make a quick stop. At the Pentagon. Right? Don\\'t worry, you\\'re gonna love the holiday menu at the commissary. They say sarcasm is a metric for potential. If that\\'s true, you\\'ll be a great man someday.   I\\'ll get the bags. He does miss you when you\\'re not here. And frankly, you\\'re going to miss us. Because this is the last time we\\'re all going to be together. You know what\\'s about to happen. Say something. If you don\\'t, you\\'ll regret it. I love you, Dad. And I know you did the best you could. That\\'s how I wish it happened. Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing... or BARF. God, I gotta work on that acronym. An extremely costly method of hijacking the hippocampus... to clear traumatic memories. Huh. It doesn\\'t change the fact that they never made it to the airport... or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but... Plus, $611 million for my little therapeutic experiment? No one in their right mind would\\'ve ever funded it. Help me out, what\\'s the MIT mission statement? \"To generate, disseminate... \"and preserve knowledge. \"And work with others... \"to bring it to bear on the world\\'s great challenges.\" Well, you are the others. And, quiet as it\\'s kept... the challenges facing you are the greatest mankind\\'s ever known. Plus, most of you are broke. Oh, I\\'m sorry. Rather, you were. As of this moment... every student has been made an equal recipient... of the inaugural September Foundation Grant. As in... all of your projects have just been approved and funded. No strings, no taxes... just reframe the future! Starting now. Go break some eggs. Wow. Wow. That took my breath away. Oh, Tony! So generous. So much money! Wow! Out of curiosity... will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty? I know, \"Ooh, gross,\" but hear me out. I have got this killer idea for a self-cooking hotdog. Basically, chemical detonator embedded... Restroom\\'s this way, yeah? Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.  Mr Stark, I am so sorry about the teleprompter. I didn\\'t know Miss Potts had cancelled. They didn\\'t have time to fix it. It\\'s fine. I\\'ll be right back. We\\'ll catch up later. That was nice, what you did for those young people. Ah, they deserve it. Plus, it helps ease my conscience. They say there\\'s a correlation between generosity and guilt. But if you\\'ve got the money... break as many eggs as you like. Right? Are you going up? I\\'m right where I want to be. Okay. Hey. Sorry, it\\'s an occupational hazard. I work for the State Department. Human Resources. I know it\\'s boring... but it enabled me to raise a son. I\\'m very proud of what he grew up to be. His name was Charlie Spencer. You murdered him. In Sokovia. Not that that matters in the least to you. You think you fight for us? You just fight for yourself. Who\\'s going to avenge my son, Stark? He\\'s dead... and I blame you. 11 Wakandans were among those killed during a confrontation... between the Avengers and a group of mercenaries... in Lagos, Nigeria last month. The traditionally reclusive Wakandans were on an outreach mission... in Lagos, when the attack occurred. Our people\\'s blood is spilled on foreign soil... not only because of the actions of criminals... but by the indifference of those pledged to stop them. Victory at the expense of the innocent... is no victory at all. The Wakandan king went on to... They are operating outside and above the international law. Because that\\'s the reality, if we don\\'t respond to acts like these. What legal authority does an enhanced individual like Wanda Maximoff have... to operate in Nigeri...? It\\'s my fault. That\\'s not true. Turn the TV back on. They\\'re being very specific. I should\\'ve clocked that bomb vest long before you had to deal with it.  Rumlow said \"Bucky\"... and all of a sudden I was a 16-year-old kid again, in Brooklyn. And people died. It\\'s on me. It\\'s on both of us. This job... We try to save as many people as we can. Sometimes that doesn\\'t mean everybody. But if we can\\'t find a way to live with that... then next time... maybe nobody gets saved. Vis! We talked about this. Yes, but the door was open so I assumed that... Captain Rogers wished to know when Mr Stark was arriving. Thank you. We\\'ll be right down. I\\'ll use the door. Oh, and apparently, he\\'s brought a guest. We know who it is? The Secretary of State. Five years ago... I had a heart attack... and dropped right in the middle of my backswing. Turned out it was the best round of my life... because after 13 hours of surgery and a triple bypass... I found something 40 years in the Army had never taught me. Perspective. The world owes the Avengers an unpayable debt. You have fought for us... protected us, risked your lives... but while a great many people see you as heroes... there are some... who would prefer the word \"vigilantes.\" What word would you use, Mr Secretary? How about \"dangerous\"? What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced individuals... who routinely ignore sovereign borders... and inflict their will wherever they choose... and who, frankly, seem unconcerned about what they leave behind? New York. Washington, D.C. Sokovia. Lagos. Okay. That\\'s enough. For the past four years, you\\'ve operated with unlimited power... and no supervision. That\\'s an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate. But I think we have a solution. The Sokovia Accords. Approved by 117 countries... it states that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organisation.  Instead... they\\'ll operate under the supervision of a United Nations panel... only when and if that panel deems it necessary. The Avengers were formed to make the world a safer place. I feel we\\'ve done that. Tell me, Captain, do you know where Thor and Banner are right now? If I misplaced a couple of 30 megaton nukes... you can bet there\\'d be consequences. Compromise. Reassurance. That\\'s how the world works. Believe me, this is the middle ground. So, there are contingencies. Three days from now, the UN meets in Vienna... to ratify the Accords. Talk it over. And if we come to a decision you don\\'t like? Then you retire. Hello? Is this your car out front? I jumped the kerb. Maybe we could... take care of it ourselves. If you wanna call the cops, that\\'s okay, too... - I guess. - No. No cops. Thank you. You have kept your looks, Colonel. Congratulations. \"Mission report. December 16, 1991.\" Who are you? My name is Zemo. I will repeat my question. Mission report, December 16, 1991. How did you find me? When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell... Black Widow released HYDRA files to the public. Millions of pages. Much of it encrypted. Not easy to decipher. But, I have experience. And patience. A man can do anything if he has those. What do you want? Mission report. December 16. Go... to... hell! HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap. So your death would not bother me. But I\\'d have to use this book... and other bloodier methods to find what I need. I don\\'t look forward to that. You\\'d only be dying for... your pride. Hail HYDRA. Secretary Ross has a Congressional Medal of Honour... which is one more than you have. So let\\'s say we agree to this thing. How long is it gonna be before they LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?  117 countries want to sign this. 117, Sam, and you\\'re just like, \"No, that\\'s cool. We got it.\" How long are you going to play both sides? I have an equation. Oh, this will clear it up. In the eight years since Mr Stark announced himself as Iron Man... the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. During the same period... the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate. Are you saying it\\'s our fault? I\\'m saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict... breeds catastrophe. Oversight... Oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand. Boom. Tony. You are being uncharacteristically non-hyperverbal. It\\'s because he\\'s already made up his mind. Boy, you know me so well. Actually, I\\'m nursing an electromagnetic headache. That\\'s what\\'s going on, Cap. It\\'s just pain. It\\'s discomfort. Who\\'s putting coffee grounds in the disposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang? Oh, that\\'s Charles Spencer, by the way. He\\'s a great kid. Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA... had a floor-level gig at Intel planned for the fall. But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul... before he parked it behind a desk. See the world. Maybe be of service. Charlie didn\\'t want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do. He didn\\'t go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where. Sokovia. He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. We won\\'t know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass. There\\'s no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! Whatever form that takes, I\\'m game.  If we can\\'t accept limitations, if we\\'re boundary-less... we\\'re no better than the bad guys. Tony, someone dies on your watch, you don\\'t give up. Who said we\\'re giving up? We are if we\\'re not taking responsibility for our actions. This document just shifts the blame. I\\'m sorry, Steve. That is dangerously arrogant. This is the United Nations we\\'re talking about. It\\'s not the World Security Council, it\\'s not S.H.I.E.L.D., it\\'s not HYDRA. No, but it\\'s run by people with agendas, and agendas change. That\\'s good. That\\'s why I\\'m here. When I realised what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands... I shut it down and stopped manufacturing. Tony, you chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don\\'t think we should go? What if there is somewhere we need to go and they don\\'t let us? We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own. If we don\\'t do this now, it\\'s gonna be done to us later. That\\'s the fact. That won\\'t be pretty. You\\'re saying they\\'ll come for me. We would protect you. Maybe Tony\\'s right. If we have one hand on the wheel, we can still steer. If we take it off... Aren\\'t you the same woman who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago? I\\'m just reading the terrain. We have made some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back. Focus up. I\\'m sorry. Did I just mishear you... - or did you agree with me? - I want to take it back now. No, you can\\'t retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented. Okay. Case closed. I win. I have to go. And now, I would like to invite Sharon Carter to come up and say a few words. Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D... but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.  She had a photograph in her office. Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK. As a kid, that was pretty cool. But it was a lot to live up to. Which is why I never told anyone we were related. I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage... in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either. She said, compromise where you can. But where you can\\'t, don\\'t. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move... it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree... look them in the eye and say \"No, you move.\" When I came out of the ice, I thought everyone I had known was gone. Then I found out she was alive. I was just lucky to have her. She had you back, too. Who else signed? Tony, Rhodey, Vision. Clint? Says he\\'s retired. - Wanda? - TBD. I\\'m off to Vienna for the signing of the Accords. There\\'s plenty of room on the jet. Just because it\\'s the path of least resistance... doesn\\'t mean it\\'s the wrong path. Staying together is more important than how we stay together. What are we giving up to do it? I\\'m sorry, Nat. I can\\'t sign it. I know. Then what are you doing here? I didn\\'t want you to be alone. Come here. At a special United Nations conference... 117 countries have come together to ratify the Sokovia Accords. Excuse me, Ms Romanoff? - Yes? - These need your signature. - Thank you. - Thanks. I suppose neither of us is used to the spotlight. Oh, well, it\\'s not always so flattering. You seem to be doing all right so far. Considering your last trip to Capitol Hill... I wouldn\\'t think you\\'d be particularly comfortable in this company. Well, I\\'m not. And that alone makes me glad you are here, Ms Romanoff. Why? You don\\'t approve of all this?  The Accords, yes. The politics, not really. Two people in a room can get more done than a hundred. Unless you need to move a piano. Ms Romanoff. King T\\'Chaka. Please, allow me to apologise for what happened in Nigeria. Thank you. Thank you for agreeing to all of this. I\\'m sad to hear that Captain Rogers will not be joining us today. Yes, so am I. If everyone could please be seated. This assembly is now in session. That is the future calling. Such a pleasure. Thank you. For a man who disapproves of diplomacy, you\\'re getting quite good at it. I\\'m happy, Father. Thank you. Thank you. When stolen Wakandan vibranium was used to make a terrible weapon... we in Wakanda were forced to question our legacy. Those men and women killed in Nigeria... were part of a goodwill mission from a country too long in the shadows. We will not, however, let misfortune drive us back. We will fight to improve the world we wish to join. I am grateful to the Avengers for supporting this initiative. Wakanda is proud to extend its hand in peace. Everybody get down! My mom tried to talk me out of enlisting... but, um, not Aunt Peggy. She bought me my first thigh holster. Very practical. And stylish. CIA has you stationed over here now? Berlin. Joint Terrorism Task Force. Right. Right. Sounds fun. I know, right? I\\'ve been meaning to ask you. When you were spying on me from across the hall... You mean when I was doing my job. Did Peggy know? She kept so many secrets. I didn\\'t want her to have one from you. Thanks for walking me back. Sure. Steve. There\\'s something you gotta see. A bomb hidden in a news van... Who\\'s coordinating? ...ripped through the UN building in Vienna. Good. They\\'re solid. Forensics? More than 70 people have been injured.  At least 12 are dead, including Wakanda\\'s King T\\'Chaka. Officials have released a video of a suspect... who they have identified as James Buchanan Barnes... the Winter Soldier. The infamous HYDRA agent... linked to numerous acts of terrorism and political assassinations. I have to go to work. Call MI6, see if we can get Micro Forensics to hurry this up. We need the whole team here in two hours or it\\'s not worth it. I\\'m very sorry. In my culture... death is not the end. It\\'s more of a stepping-off point. You reach out with both hands... and Bast and Sekhmet, they lead you into the green veldt... where you can run forever. That sounds very peaceful. My father thought so. I am not my father. T\\'Challa... Task Force will decide who brings in Barnes. Don\\'t bother, Ms Romanoff. I\\'ll kill him myself. Yeah? You all right? Uh, yeah, thanks. I got lucky. I know how much Barnes means to you. I really do. Stay home. You\\'ll only make this worse. For all of us. Please. Are you saying you\\'ll arrest me? No. Someone will. If you interfere. That\\'s how it works now. If he\\'s this far gone, Nat, I should be the one to bring him in. Why? Because I\\'m the one least likely to die trying. Shit. She tell you to stay out of it? Might have a point. He\\'d do it for me. 1945, maybe. I just want to make sure we consider all our options. The people that shoot at you usually wind up shooting at me. Tips have been pouring in since that footage went public. Everybody thinks the Winter Soldier goes to their gym. Most of it\\'s noise. Except for this. My boss expects a briefing, pretty much now... so that\\'s all the head start you\\'re gonna get. Thank you. You\\'re gonna have to hurry. We have orders to shoot on sight.  Homecoming One One Freight car I have your breakfast. I could smell it before I opened the door. Side of bacon and black coffee. Again. I can make you something different, if you like. This is wonderful... I will just put this on your... It\\'s okay, I can manage! Heads up, Cap. German Special Forces, approaching from the south. Understood. Do you know me? You\\'re Steve. I read about you in a museum. They\\'ve set the perimeter. I know you\\'re nervous, and you have plenty of reason to be. But you\\'re lying. I wasn\\'t in Vienna. I don\\'t do that any more. They\\'re entering the building. Well, the people who think you did are coming here now. And they\\'re not planning on taking you alive. That\\'s smart. Good strategy. They\\'re on the roof. I\\'m compromised. This doesn\\'t have to end in a fight, Buck. - It always ends in a fight. - Five seconds. You pulled me from the river. Why? - I don\\'t know. - Three seconds. Yes, you do. Breach! Breach! Breach! Buck, stop! You\\'re gonna kill someone. I\\'m not gonna kill anyone. Suspect has broken containment! ...he\\'s headed down the east stairwell! Come on, man. Ahhh! Sam, southwest rooftop. Who the hell\\'s the other guy? About to find out. - Sam. - Got him. Stand down! Stand down! Sam, I can\\'t shake this guy. Right behind you. Stand down, now. Congratulations, Cap. You\\'re a criminal. Your Highness. \"A pinch of paprika.\" A pinch. Is that paprikash? I thought it might lift your spirits. Spirits lifted. In my defence, I haven\\'t actually ever eaten anything before, so... May I? Please. - Wanda? - Hmm. No one dislikes you, Wanda. Thanks. Oh, you\\'re welcome. No, it\\'s a involuntary response in their amygdala. They can\\'t help but be afraid of you. Are you? My amygdala is synthetic, so...  I used to think of myself one way. But after this... I am something else. I\\'m still me, I think, but... that\\'s not what everyone else sees. Do you know, I don\\'t know what this is? Not really. I know it\\'s not of this world... that it powered Loki\\'s staff, gave you your abilities, but... its true nature is a mystery. And yet, it is part of me. Are you afraid of it? I wish to understand it. The more I do, the less it controls me. One day... who knows? I may even control it. I don\\'t know what\\'s in this but it is not paprika. I\\'m gonna go to the store. I\\'ll be back in 20 minutes. Alternatively, we could order a pizza? Vision, are you not letting me leave? It is a question of safety. I can protect myself. Not yours. Mr Stark would like to avoid the possibility of another public incident. Until the Accords are on a more secure foundation. And what do you want? For people to see you... as I do. So, you like cats? - Sam. - What? Dude shows up dressed like a cat, you don\\'t wanna know more? Your suit... it\\'s vibranium? The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations. A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior. And now, because your friend murdered my father... I also wear the mantle of king. So, I ask you... as both warrior and king... how long do you think you can keep your friend safe from me? What\\'s gonna happen to him? Same thing that ought to happen to you. Psychological evaluation and extradition. This is Everett Ross, Deputy Task Force Commander. What about a lawyer? Lawyer. That\\'s funny. See their weapons are placed in lockup. We\\'ll write you a receipt. I better not look out the window and see anybody flying around in that. You\\'ll be provided with an office instead of a cell.  Now, do me a favour, stay in it? I don\\'t intend on going anywhere. For the record, this is what making things worse looks like. He\\'s alive. No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup. Try not to break anything while we fix this. Consequences? You bet there\\'ll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that, because I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir. \"Consequences\"? Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something. I\\'m not getting that shield back, am I? Technically, it\\'s the government\\'s property. Wings, too. That\\'s cold. Warmer than jail. Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad\\'s archives. Felt timely. FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most. Some would say it brought our country closer to war. See? If not for these, you wouldn\\'t be here. I\\'m trying to... What do you call it? That\\'s an olive branch. Is that what you call it? Is Pepper here? I didn\\'t see her. We\\'re kinda... - Well, not kinda... - Pregnant? No. Definitely not. We\\'re taking a break. It\\'s nobody\\'s fault. I\\'m so sorry, Tony. I didn\\'t know. A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to mop up HYDRA... and then Ultron. My fault. And then, and then, and then, I never stopped. Because the truth is I don\\'t wanna stop. I don\\'t wanna lose her. I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference. In her defence, I\\'m a handful. Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work. I\\'m glad Howard got married. I only knew him when he was young and single. Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times.  God, I hated you. I don\\'t mean to make things difficult. I know, because you\\'re a very polite person. If I see a situation pointed south... I can\\'t ignore it. Sometimes I wish I could. No, you don\\'t. No, I don\\'t. Sometimes... Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don\\'t wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing\\'s happened that can\\'t be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-centre... instead of a Wakandan prison. I\\'m not saying it\\'s impossible... but there would have to be safeguards. Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I\\'d file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated... Wanda? What about Wanda? She\\'s fine. She\\'s confined to the compound, currently. Vision\\'s keeping her company. Oh, God, Tony. Every time I think you see things the right way... It\\'s 100 acres with a lap pool. It\\'s got a screening room. There\\'s worse ways to protect people. Protection? Is that how you see this? This is protection? It\\'s internment, Tony. - She\\'s not a US citizen. - Oh, come on, Tony. And they don\\'t grant visas to weapons of mass destruction. She\\'s a kid! Give me a break! I\\'m doing what has to be done. To stave off something worse. You keep telling yourself that. Hate to break up the set. Hello, Mr Barnes. I\\'ve been sent by the United Nations to evaluate you. Do you mind if I sit? Your first name is James? The receipt for your gear. \"Bird costume\"? Come on. I didn\\'t write it. I\\'m not here to judge you. I just want to ask you a few questions. Do you know where you are, James? I can\\'t help you if you don\\'t talk to me, James. My name is Bucky. Hello? Hey! Why would the Task Force release this photo to begin with?  Get the word out, involve as many eyes as we can? Right. It\\'s a good way to flush a guy out of hiding. Set off a bomb, get your picture taken. Get seven billion people looking for the Winter Soldier. You\\'re saying someone framed him to find him? Steve, we looked for the guy for two years and found nothing. We didn\\'t bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads. Yeah, but that doesn\\'t guarantee that whoever framed him would get him. It guarantees that we would. Yeah. Tell me, Bucky. You\\'ve seen a great deal, haven\\'t you? I don\\'t wanna talk about it. You fear that if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop. Don\\'t worry. We only have to talk about one. Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes. Friday, get me a source on that outage. Sub-level five, East Wing. What the hell is this? Why don\\'t we discuss your home? Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no. I mean your real home. Longing No. Rusted Stop. Seventeen Stop. Daybreak Furnace Nine Benign Homecoming One Freight car Soldier? Ready to comply. Mission report. December 16, 1991. Help me. Help. Get up. Who are you? What do you want? To see an empire fall. Hey. Evac all civilians. Get me a perimeter around the building, and gunships in the air. Please tell me you brought a suit. Sure did. It\\'s a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece, two-button. I\\'m an active-duty non-combatant. Follow me. We\\'re in position. You could at least recognise me. Damn it. He asked me again if you were going to be there. I said I wasn\\'t sure. You should have seen his little face. Just try, okay? I\\'m going to bed. I love you. James Barnes the suspect in the UN Vienna bombing... ...escaped custody today. ...also missing Avenger Captain Steve Rogers... and Sam Wilson. Hey, Cap!  Steve. Which Bucky am I talking to? Your mom\\'s name was Sarah. You used to wear newspapers in your shoes. Can\\'t read that in a museum. Just like that, we\\'re supposed to be cool? What did I do? Enough. Oh, God, I knew this would happen. Everything HYDRA put inside me is still there. All he had to do was say the goddamn words. - Who was he? - I don\\'t know. People are dead. The bombing, the setup... the doctor did all that just to get 10 minutes with you. I need you to do better than \"I don\\'t know.\" He wanted to know about Siberia. Where I was kept. He wanted to know exactly where. Why would he need to know that? Because I\\'m not the only Winter Soldier. It hurts! Good work. Get me out of here. Who were they? Their most elite death squad. More kills than anyone in HYDRA history. And that was before the serum. They all turn out like you? Worse. The doctor, could he control them? Enough. Said he wanted to see an empire fall. With these guys, he could do it. They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight... infiltrate, assassinate, destabilise. They can take a whole country down in one night, you\\'d never see them coming. This would have been a lot easier a week ago. - If we call Tony... - No, he won\\'t believe us. Even if he did... Who knows if the Accords would let him help. We\\'re on our own. Maybe not. I know a guy. I don\\'t suppose you have any idea where they are? We will. GSG 9\\'s got the borders covered. Recon\\'s flying 24/7. They\\'ll get a hit. We\\'ll handle it. You don\\'t get it, Stark. It\\'s not yours to handle. It\\'s clear you can\\'t be objective. I\\'m putting Special Ops on this. What happens when the shooting starts? What, do you kill Steve Rogers? If we\\'re provoked. Barnes would\\'ve been eliminated  in Romania if it wasn\\'t for Rogers. There are dead people who would be alive now. Feel free to check my math. All due respect, you\\'re not gonna solve this with boys and bullets, Ross. You gotta let us bring them in. How would that end any differently than last time? Because this time, I won\\'t be wearing loafers and a silk shirt. 72 hours, guaranteed. 36 hours. Barnes. Rogers. Wilson. Thank you, sir. My left arm is numb. Is that normal? You all right? Always. 36 hours. Jeez. We\\'re seriously understaffed. Oh, yeah. It\\'d be great if we had a Hulk right about now. Any shot? You really think he\\'d be on our side? No. I have an idea. Me, too. Where\\'s yours? Downstairs. Where\\'s yours? Hey, May. Mmm. Hey. How was school today? It was okay. This crazy car parked outside. - Oh, Mr Parker. - Um... What are you doing... Hey! Uh, I\\'m Peter. Tony. What are you doing here? It\\'s about time we met. You\\'ve been getting my emails, right? - Yeah. Yeah. - Right? Regarding the... You didn\\'t even tell me about the grant. - About the grant. - The September Foundation. - Right. - Yeah. Remember when you applied? Yeah. I approved, so now we\\'re in business. But you didn\\'t tell me anything. What\\'s up with that? You keeping secrets from me now? I just know how much you love surprises so I thought I would let you know... Anyway, what did I apply for? That\\'s what I\\'m here to hash out. Okay. Hash it out, okay. It\\'s so hard for me to believe that she\\'s someone\\'s aunt. Yeah, well, we come in all shapes and sizes, you know? This walnut date loaf is exceptional. - Let me just stop you there. - Yeah. Is this grant got money involved or whatever? No? Yeah, it\\'s pretty well funded. Yeah? Wow. Look who you\\'re talking to. - Can I have five minutes with him?  - Sure. As walnut date loaves go, that wasn\\'t bad. Whoa, what have we here? Retro tech, huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army? - Uh, the garbage, actually. - You\\'re a dumpster diver? Yeah, I was... Anyway, look, um, I definitely did not apply for your grant... - Ah-ah! Me first. - Okay. Quick question of the rhetorical variety. That\\'s you, right? Um, no. - What do you mean? - Yeah. Look at you go. Wow! Nice catch. 3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour. That\\'s not easy. You got mad skills. That\\'s all on YouTube, though, right? That\\'s where you found that? Because you know that\\'s all fake. It\\'s all done on the computer. Mmm-hmm. It\\'s like that video. What is it? Yeah. Oh, you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix? Exactly. Oh, what have we here? Uh... You\\'re the Spider-ling. Crime-fighting spider. You\\'re Spider-Boy? Spider-Man. Not in that onesie, you\\'re not. It\\'s not a onesie. I don\\'t believe this. I was actually having a really good day today, Mr Stark. Didn\\'t miss my train, this perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there... and Algebra test, nailed it. Who else knows? Anybody? Nobody. Not even your unusually attractive aunt? No. No. No! If she knew, she would freak out. And when she freaks out, I freak out. You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. That tensile strength is off the charts. Who manufactured that? I did. Climbing walls, how you doing that? Adhesive gloves? It\\'s a long story. I was... Lordy! Can you even see in these? Yes, I can. I\\'m blind! I can see in those. Okay? It\\'s just that when whatever happened, happened... it\\'s like my senses have been dialled to 11. There\\'s way too much input, so they just kinda help me focus. You\\'re in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom,  hundred-point restoration. That\\'s why I\\'m here. Why you doing this? I gotta know, what\\'s your MO? What gets you outta that twin bed in the morning? Because... Because I\\'ve been me my whole life, and I\\'ve had these powers for six months. Mmm-hmm. I read books, I build computers. Yeah, I would love to play football, but I couldn\\'t then, so I shouldn\\'t now. Sure, because you\\'re different. Exactly. But I can\\'t tell anybody that, so I\\'m not. When you can do the things that I can, but you don\\'t... and then the bad things happen... they happen because of you. So you wanna look out for the little guy, you wanna do your part? Make the world a better place, all that, right? Yeah, just looking out for the little guy. That\\'s what it is. I\\'m gonna sit here, so you move the leg. You got a passport? No, I don\\'t even have a driver\\'s licence. - You ever been to Germany? - No. Oh, you\\'ll love it. - I can\\'t go to Germany. - Why? I got homework. I\\'m gonna pretend you didn\\'t say that. No, I\\'m being serious. I can\\'t just drop out of school. Might be a little dangerous. Better tell Aunt Hottie I\\'m taking you on a field trip. Don\\'t tell Aunt May. All right, Spider-Man. Get me out of this. Sorry. I\\'ll get the... What is it? Stay here, please. Guess I shoulda knocked. Oh, my God! What are you doing here? Disappointing my kids. I\\'m supposed to go waterskiing. Cap needs our help. Come on. Clint! You should not be here. Really? I retire for, what, like five minutes, and it all goes to shit. Please consider the consequences of your actions. Okay, they\\'re considered. Okay, we gotta go. It\\'s this way. I\\'ve caused enough problems. You gotta help me, Wanda. Look, you wanna mope, you can go to high school. You wanna make amends,  you get off your ass. Shit. I knew I should\\'ve stretched. Clint, you can\\'t overpower me. I know I can\\'t. But she can. Vision, that\\'s enough. Let him go. I\\'m leaving. I can\\'t let you. I\\'m sorry. If you do this... they will never stop being afraid of you. I can\\'t control their fear, only my own. Oh... Come on. We got one more stop. It\\'s just a matter of time. Our satellites are running facial, biometric, and behavioural pattern scans. Move or you will be moved. As entertaining as that would be... You really think you can find him? My resources are considerable. Yeah, it took the world 70 years to find Barnes... so you could probably do that in about half the time. You know where they are. I know someone who does. Not sure you understand the concept of a getaway car. It\\'s low profile. Good, because this stuff tends to draw a crowd. Can you move your seat up? No. I owe you again. Keeping a list. You know, he kinda tried to kill me. Sorry. I\\'ll put it on the list, too. They\\'re going to come looking for you. I know. Thank you, Sharon. That was... Late. Damn right. I should go. Okay. Cap. You know I wouldn\\'t have called if I had any other choice. Hey, man, you\\'re doing me a favour. Besides, I owe a debt. Thanks for having my back. It was time to get off my ass. How about our other recruit? He\\'s rarin\\' to go. Had to put a little coffee in him... but he should be good. What time zone is this? Come on. Come on. - Captain America! - Mr Lang. It\\'s an honour. I\\'m shaking your hand too long. Wow! This is awesome! Captain America. I know you, too. You\\'re great! Jeez. Ah, look, I wanna say, I know you know a lot of super people, so... thinks for thanking of me. - Hey, man! - What\\'s up, Tic Tac? Uh, good to see you.  Look, what happened last time when I... It was a great audition, but it\\'ll never happen again. They tell you what we\\'re up against? Something about some psycho-assassins? We\\'re outside the law on this one. So if you come with us, you\\'re a wanted man. Yeah, well, what else is new? We should get moving. We got a chopper lined up. They\\'re evacuating the airport. Stark. Stark? Suit up. Wow, it\\'s so weird how you run into people at the airport. - Don\\'t you think that\\'s weird? - Definitely weird. Hear me out, Tony. That doctor, the psychiatrist, he\\'s behind all of this. Captain. Your Highness. Anyway... Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. Can you help a brother out? You\\'re after the wrong guy. Your judgement is askew. Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday. And there are five more super soldiers just like him. I can\\'t let the doctor find them first, Tony. I can\\'t. Steve... you know what\\'s about to happen. Do you really wanna punch your way out of this one? All right, I\\'ve run out of patience. Underoos! - Nice job, kid. - Thanks. I could have stuck the landing a little better, it\\'s just... New suit. It\\'s nothing, Mr Stark. It\\'s perfect. Thank you. Yeah, we don\\'t really need to start a conversation. Okay. Cap. Captain. Big fan. I\\'m Spider-Man. Yeah, we\\'ll talk about it later. - Hey, everyone. - Good job. You\\'ve been busy. And you\\'ve been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint... \"Rescuing\" Wanda from a place she doesn\\'t even want to leave, a safe place. I\\'m trying to keep... I\\'m trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart. You did that when you signed. All right, we\\'re done. You\\'re gonna turn Barnes over, you\\'re gonna come with us, now, because it\\'s us... or a squad of J-SOC guys...  with no compunction about being impolite. Come on. We found it. Their Quinjet\\'s in hangar five, north runway. All right, Lang. Hey, guys, something... Whoa. What the hell was that? I believe this is yours, Captain America. Oh, great. All right, there\\'s two on the parking deck. One of them\\'s Maximoff, I\\'m gonna grab her. Rhodey, you wanna take Cap? Got two in the terminal, Wilson and Barnes. Barnes is mine. Hey, Mr Stark, what should I do? What we discussed. Keep your distance, web them up. Okay, copy that. Move, Captain. I won\\'t ask a second time. Look, I really don\\'t want to hurt you. I wouldn\\'t stress about it. What the hell is that? Everyone\\'s got a gimmick now. You have a metal arm? That is awesome, dude. You have the right to remain silent! Sorry, Cap, this won\\'t kill you... but it ain\\'t gonna tickle either. Wanda, I think you hurt Vision\\'s feelings. You locked me in my room. Okay, first, that\\'s an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. - Hey, Clint. - Hey, man. Clearly, retirement doesn\\'t suit you. You got tired of shooting golf? Well, I played 18, shot 18. Just can\\'t seem to miss. First time for everything. Made you look. Multiple contusions detected. Yeah, I detected that, too. Oh, God! Hey, buddy, I think you lost this! Ahh! Those wings carbon fibre? Is this stuff coming out of you? That would explain the rigidity-flexibility ratio, which, gotta say, that\\'s awesome, man. I don\\'t know if you\\'ve been in a fight before... but there\\'s usually not this much talking. All right, sorry. My bad. Guys, look, I\\'d love to keep this up, but I\\'ve only got one job here today... and I gotta impress Mr Stark, so, I\\'m really sorry. You couldn\\'t have done that earlier? I hate you. Great.  Hey, Cap, heads-up! Throw it at this. Now! Oh, come on! Oh, man, I thought it was a water truck. Uh, sorry. All right, now I\\'m pissed. Is this part of the plan? Well, my plan was go easy on them. You wanna switch it up? There\\'s our ride. Come on! Captain Rogers... I know you believe what you\\'re doing is right. But for the collective good... you must surrender now. What do we do, Cap? We fight. This is gonna end well. They\\'re not stopping. Neither are we. We\\'re still friends, right? Depends on how hard you hit me. You were pulling your punches. I didn\\'t kill your father. Then why did you run? That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all. Look, kid, there\\'s a lot going on here that you don\\'t understand. Mr Stark said you\\'d say that. Wow. He also said to go for your legs. Ahh! Clint, can you get him off me? Buckled in? Yeah. No, I\\'m good. I\\'m good, Arrow Guy. Let\\'s go! Stark tell you anything else? That you\\'re wrong. You think you\\'re right. That makes you dangerous. Guess he had a point. You got heart, kid. Where you from? Queens. Brooklyn. Friday? We have some weapon systems offline. What? Oh, you\\'re gonna have to take this into the shop. Who\\'s speaking? It\\'s your conscience. We don\\'t talk a lot these days. Friday? Deploying fire suppression system. Uh-oh. Oh, boy! Whoa! We gotta go. That guy\\'s probably in Siberia by now. We gotta draw out the flyers. I\\'ll take Vision, you get to the jet. No, you get to the jet! Both of you! The rest of us aren\\'t getting out of here. As much as I hate to admit it... if we\\'re gonna win this one, some of us might have to lose it. This isn\\'t the real fight, Steve. All right, Sam. What\\'s the play? We need a diversion. Something big. I got something kinda big.  But I can\\'t hold it very long. On my signal, run like hell. And if I tear myself in half... don\\'t come back for me. He\\'s gonna tear himself in half? You sure about this, Scott? I do it all the time. I mean, once. In a lab. Then I passed out. I\\'m the boss, I\\'m the boss, I\\'m the boss. Holy shit! Okay, tiny dude is big now. He\\'s big now. I guess that\\'s the signal. Way to go, Tic Tac! Give me back my Rhodey. I got him. Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they\\'d like to disclose... I\\'m open to suggestions. You wanna get to them... you gotta go through me. Uh-huh. We haven\\'t met yet. - I\\'m Clint. - I don\\'t care. Whoa! Ahhh! Get off! Something just flew in me! You\\'re not gonna stop. You know I can\\'t. I\\'m gonna regret this. Go. Hey, guys, you ever see that really old movie, Empire Strikes Back? Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy? I don\\'t know, I didn\\'t carbon-date him. He\\'s on the young side. You know that part where they\\'re on the snow planet... with the walking thingies? Maybe the kid\\'s onto something. High now, Tony. Go high. Yes! That was awesome! Does anyone have any orange slices? Kid, you all right? Whoa! Same side. Guess who. Hi. It\\'s me. - Hey, man. - Yeah. - That was scary. - Yeah. You\\'re done, all right? What? I\\'m good, I\\'m fine. You did a good job. Stay down. No, it\\'s good. I gotta get him back. You\\'re going home or I\\'ll call Aunt May! - Dude. - You\\'re done! Wait. Mr Stark, wait. I\\'m not done. I\\'m not... Okay, I\\'m done. I\\'m done. I said I\\'d help you find him, not catch him. There\\'s a difference. I\\'m sorry. Me, too. It\\'s as I said. Catastrophe. Vision, I got a bandit on my six. Vision! You copy? Target his thruster, turn him into a glider. Rhodey! Tony, I\\'m flying dead stick.  Rhodes! Read vitals. Heartbeat detected. Emergency medical is on its way. I\\'m sorry. - this is room 201... Bacon and black coffee again today? You know me so well... Hello? Your breakfast is here. May I let myself in? What\\'s gonna happen to your friends? Whatever it is... I\\'ll deal with it. I don\\'t know if I\\'m worth all this, Steve. What you did all those years... It wasn\\'t you. You didn\\'t have a choice. I know. But I did it. How did this happen? I became distracted. I didn\\'t think that was possible. Neither did I. The doctors say he shattered L4 through S1. Extreme laceration to the spinal cord. Probably looking at some form of paralysis. Steve\\'s not gonna stop. If you don\\'t either, Rhodey\\'s gonna be the best case scenario. You let them go, Nat. We played this wrong. \"We\"? Boy, it must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA. Are you incapable of letting go of your ego... for one goddamn second? T\\'Challa told Ross what you did, so... they\\'re coming for you. I\\'m not the one that needs to watch their back. What am I looking at, Friday? Priority upload from Berlin police. Fire up the chopper. The Task Force called for a psychiatrist as soon as Barnes was captured. The UN dispatched Doctor Theo Broussard from Geneva within the hour. He was met by this man. Did you run facial recognition yet? What do I look like? Uh, I don\\'t know. I\\'ve been picturing a redhead. You must be thinking of someone else. Must be. The fake doctor is actually Colonel Helmut Zemo. Sokovian Intelligence. Zemo ran Echo Scorpion... a Sokovian covert kill squad. What happened to the real Broussard? He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. Where police also found a wig and facial prosthesis...  approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes. Son of a bitch. - Get this to Ross. - Yes, boss. This is Raft Prison Control. You\\'re cleared for landing, Mr Stark. So? You got the files? Let\\'s reroute the satellites, start facial scanning for this Zemo guy. You seriously think I\\'m gonna listen to you after that fiasco in Leipzig? You\\'re lucky you\\'re not in one of these cells. The Futurist, gentlemen! The Futurist is here! He sees all! He knows what\\'s best for you, whether you like it or not. Give me a break, Barton. I had no idea they\\'d put you here. Come on. Yeah, well, you knew they\\'d put us somewhere, Tony. Yeah, but not some super-max floating ocean pokey. This place is for maniacs. This is a place for... Criminals? Criminals, Tony. Think that\\'s the word you\\'re looking for. Right? That didn\\'t used to mean me. Or Sam, or Wanda. But here we are. - Because you broke the law. - Yeah. I didn\\'t make you. - La, la, la, la, la... - You read it, you broke it. You\\'re all grown up, you got a wife and kids. I don\\'t understand, why didn\\'t you think about them before you chose the wrong side? You gotta watch your back with this guy. There\\'s a chance he\\'s gonna break it. Hank Pym always said you never can trust a Stark. Who are you? Come on, man. How\\'s Rhodes? They\\'re flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow... so fingers crossed. What do you need? They feed you yet? You\\'re the good cop, now? I\\'m just the guy who needs to know where Steve went. Well, you better go get a bad cop... because you\\'re gonna have to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass... to get information out of me. Well, I just knocked the A out of their AV. We got about 30 seconds before they realise it\\'s not their equipment. What\\'d you do? Get it back up!  Just look. Because that... is the fellow who was supposed to interrogate Barnes. Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong. That\\'s a first. Cap is definitely off the reservation... but he\\'s about to need all the help he can get. We don\\'t know each other very well. You don\\'t have to... Hey, it\\'s all right. Look, I\\'ll tell you... but you have to go alone and as a friend. Easy. Stark? Did he give you anything on Rogers? Nope. Told me to go to hell. I\\'m going back to the compound instead, but you can call me anytime. I\\'ll put you on hold. I like to watch the line blink. You remember that time we had to ride back from Rockaway Beach in the back of that freezer truck? Was that the time we used our train money to buy hot dogs? You blew three bucks trying to win that stuffed bear for a redhead. What was her name, again? Dolores. You called her Dot. She\\'s gotta be a hundred years old right now. So are we, pal. He can\\'t have been here more than a few hours. Long enough to wake them up. You ready? Yeah. You seem a little defensive. It\\'s been a long day. At ease, Soldier. I\\'m not currently after you. Then why are you here? Could be your story\\'s not so crazy. Maybe. Ross has no idea I\\'m here. I\\'d like to keep it that way. Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself. Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork. It\\'s good to see you, Tony. You too, Cap. Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you\\'re killing me. There\\'s a truce here. You can drop... I got heat signatures. How many? Uh, one. If it\\'s any comfort, they died in their sleep. Did you really think I wanted more of you? What the hell? I\\'m grateful to them, though. They brought you here. Please, Captain. The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.  I\\'m betting I could beat that. Oh, I\\'m sure you could, Mr Stark. Given time. But then you\\'d never know why you came. You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here? I\\'ve thought about nothing else for over a year. I studied you. I followed you. But now that you\\'re standing here... I just realised... there\\'s a bit of green in the blue of your eyes. How nice to find a flaw. You\\'re Sokovian. Is that what this is about? Sokovia was a failed state long before you blew it to hell. No. I\\'m here because I made a promise. You lost someone? I lost everyone. And so will you. An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumbles from within? That\\'s dead. Forever. I know that road. What is this? Help my wife. Please. Help. Sergeant Barnes? Howard! Howard! No, Tony. Did you know? I didn\\'t know it was him. Don\\'t bullshit me, Rogers. Did you know? Yes. Get out of here! It wasn\\'t him, Tony. HYDRA had control of his mind! Move! It wasn\\'t him! Left bootjet failing. Flight systems compromised. Ah, crap. He\\'s not gonna stop. Go. Come on, come on. Targeting system\\'s knackered, boss. I\\'m eyeballing it. Do you even remember them? I remember all of them. This isn\\'t gonna change what happened. I don\\'t care. He killed my mom. You should have seen his little face. Just try, okay? I\\'m going to bed. I love you. I almost killed the wrong man. Hardly an innocent one. This is all you wanted? To see them rip each other apart. My father lived outside the city. I thought we would be safe there. My son was excited. He could see the Iron Man from the car window. I told my wife, \"Don\\'t worry. \"They\\'re fighting in the city. We\\'re miles from harm.\" When the dust cleared... and the screaming stopped...  it took me two days until I found their bodies. My father... still holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers? They went home. I knew I couldn\\'t kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But, if I could get them to kill each other... I\\'m sorry about your father. He seemed a good man. With a dutiful son. Vengeance has consumed you. It\\'s consuming them. I am done letting it consume me. Justice will come soon enough. Tell that to the dead. The living are not done with you, yet. You can\\'t beat him hand-to-hand. Analyse his fight pattern. Scanning. Countermeasures ready. Let\\'s kick his ass. He\\'s my friend. So was I. Stay down. Final warning. I could do this all day. That shield doesn\\'t belong to you. You don\\'t deserve it. My father made that shield! Meals at 8 and 5. Toilet privileges twice a day. Raise your voice, zap. Touch the glass, zap. You step out of line, you deal with me. Please, step out of line, hmm? So how does it feel? To spend all that time, all that effort... to see it fail so spectacularly? Did it? - It\\'s just the first pass. - Yeah. Give me some feedback, anything you think of. Shock absorption, lateral movement. Cup holder? You may wanna think about some AC down in... Ow. Let\\'s go. I\\'ll give you a hand. No. Don\\'t help me. Ah. 138 combat missions. That\\'s how many I\\'ve flown, Tony. Every one of them could\\'ve been my last, but I flew them. Because the fight needed to be fought. It\\'s the same with these Accords. I signed because it was the right thing to do. And yeah, this sucks. This is, uh... This is a bad beat. But it hasn\\'t changed my mind. I don\\'t think. - You okay? - Oh, yeah. Are you Tony Stank? Yes, this is Tony Stank. You\\'re in the right place. Thank you for that!  Never dropping that, by the way. \"Table for one, Mr Stank. \"Please, by the bathroom.\" Tony... I\\'m glad you\\'re back at the compound. I don\\'t like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours. Maybe more so than mine. I\\'ve been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, even in the Army. My faith\\'s in people, I guess. Individuals. And I\\'m happy to say that, for the most part... they haven\\'t let me down. Which is why I can\\'t let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but maybe they shouldn\\'t. I know I hurt you, Tony. I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents... I was sparing you... but I can see now that I was really sparing myself. And I\\'m sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords. I really do. I know you\\'re doing what you believe in, and that\\'s all any of us can do. That\\'s all any of us should. Priority call from Secretary Ross. There\\'s been a breach at the Raft prison. Yeah, put him through. Tony, we have a problem. - Uh, please hold. - No, don\\'t. So no matter what... I promise you... if you need us... if you need me... I\\'ll be there. You sure about this? I can\\'t trust my own mind. So, until they figure out how to get this stuff out of my head... I think going back under is the best thing. For everybody. Thank you for this. Your friend and my father... they were both victims. If I can help one of them find peace... You know, if they find out he\\'s here... they\\'ll come for him. Let them try. Hey, shady baby I\\'m hot like the prodigal son Pick a petal Eenie, meenie, miney, moe And flower You\\'re the chosen one Well, your left hand\\'s free And your right\\'s in a grip With another left hand  Watch his right hand slip Towards his gun Oh, no I tackle, we tussle Oh, my days, we\\'re rolling My right hand\\'s gripped on his Colt Single Action Army Oh, no Well, your left hand\\'s free And your right\\'s in a grip With another left hand Watch his right hand slip Towards his gun Oh, no N-E-O, O-M-G Gee whiz Girl, you\\'re the one for me Though your man\\'s bigger than I am Oh, my days He disagrees Oh, no Speak easy Well, my left hand\\'s free Oh Well, my left hand\\'s free Oh Well, my left hand\\'s free Oh Oh, no Hey, shady baby I\\'m hot like the prodigal son Pick a petal Eenie, meenie, miney, moe And flower You\\'re the chosen one Well, your left hand\\'s free Oh Well, my left hand\\'s free Oh Well, my left hand\\'s free Oh Well, my left hand\\'s free Oh Well, my left hand\\'s free Oh Oh, no Who was it? Who hit you? Some guy. So itchy, man, God. What\\'s \"some guy\\'s\" name? Uh, Steve. Steve? From 12-C? - With the overbite? - No, no, no. You don\\'t know him. He\\'s from Brooklyn. Ouch. Well... I hope you got a few good licks in. Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually. His friend was huge. Like huge. That\\'s way better. Thank you. Okay, tough guy. Love you, May. Hey, can you shut the door?

       " 'Doctor Strange': ['1 Master Kaecilius. That ritual will bring you only sorrow. Hypocrite! Challenge round, Billy. Oh, come on, Billy. You\\'ve got to be messing with me. No, doctor. Feels So Good, Chuck Mangione, 1977. Seriously, Billy, you said this one would be hard. - Hah! It\\'s 1978. No, Billy, while Feels So Good may have charted in 1978, the album was released in December, 1977. No, no. Wikipedia says the... - Check again. When did you...? - Where do you store all this useless information? Useless? The man charted a top ten hit with a Flugelhorn. - Status, Billy? - 1977. - Oh! Please. I hate you. Woah! \"Feels so good\", doesn\\'t it? Oh, I... I\\'ve got this, Stephen. You\\'ve done your bit. Go ahead, we\\'ll close up. - What is that? - GSW. It\\'s amazing you kept him alive. Apneic, further brain stem testing after reflex test... I think I found the problem, Dr. Palmer. You left a bullet in his head. - Thanks. It\\'s impinging on the medulla. I needed a specialist to diagnose brain death. Something about that doesn\\'t feel right to me. We have to run. Dr. West! What are you doing? Hey! - Organ harvesting. He\\'s a donor. Slow down. I did not agree to that. - I don\\'t need you to. We\\'ve already called brain death. Too premature. We need to get him prepped for a suboccipital craniotomy. I\\'m not going to let you operate on a dead man. - What do you see? A bullet? - A perfect bullet. It\\'s been hardened. You harden a bullet by alloying lead with antimony. A toxic metal. And as it leaks directly into the cerebral spinal fluid... Rapid-onset central nervous system shutdown. - We need to go. The patient\\'s not dead, but he\\'s dying. Do you still want to harvest his organs? I\\'ll assist you. - No! Dr. Palmer will assist me. Thank you. Image status, STAT. - We do not have time for that. You can\\'t do it by hand. - I can and I will. This isn\\'t the time for showing off, Strange. How about ten minutes ago, when you called the wrong time of death? Cranial nerves intact. Dr. West, cover your watch. You know, you didn\\'t have to humiliate him in front of everyone. I didn\\'t have to save his patient either. But, you know, sometimes I just can\\'t help myself. Nick is a great doctor. - You came to me. Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion. - You had a second opinion. What you needed was a competent one. - Well, all the more reason why you should be my neurosurgeon on call. You could make such a difference. I can\\'t work in your butcher shop. - Hey! Look, he... Look, I\\'m using trans-sectioned spinal cords to stimulate neurogenesis in the central nervous system. My work is at least going to save thousands for years to come. In the ER, I get to save one drunk idiot with a gun. Yeah, you\\'re right. In the ER, you\\'re only saving lives. There\\'s no fame, there\\'s no CNN interviews... Well, I guess I\\'ll have to stick with Nick. Oh, wait a minute. You\\'re not... you guys aren\\'t... What? - Sleeping together. Sorry, I thought that was implicit in my disgust. Explicit, actually. And no, I have a very strict rule against dating colleagues. Oh really? - I call it the Strange policy. Oh, good! I\\'m glad something is named after me. You know, I invented a laminectomy procedure, and yet, somehow, no one seems to want to call it the Strange technique. We invented that technique. - You know, I gotta say, I\\'m very flattered by your policy. Look, I\\'m talking tonight at a Neurological Society dinner. Come with me. Another speaking engagement? So romantic. You used to love going to those things with me.   We had fun together. - No. You\\'ve had fun. They weren\\'t about us, they were about you. - Not only about me. - Stephen. Everything is about you. Maybe we can hyphenate. Strange-Palmer technique. Palmer-Strange. Billy! What have you got for me? I\\'ve got a 35-year-old Air Force colonel. Crushed his lower spine in some kind of experimental armor. Mid-thoracic vertebral fracture. Well, I could help, but so can 50 other people. Find me something worth my time. I have a 68-year-old female with an advanced brain stem glioma. Yeah, you want me to screw up my perfect record? Definitely not. How about a 22-year-old female with an electronic implant in her brain to control schizophrenia struck by lightning? That does sound interesting. Could you send me the... got it. Hey. It\\'s okay. It\\'s going to be okay. What did they do? They rushed you in a chopper. But it took a little while to find you. Golden hours for nerve damage went by while you were in the car. What did they do?!? 11 stainless steel pins in the bones. Multiple torn ligaments. Severe nerve damage in both hands. You were on the table for 11 hours. Look at these fixators. No one could have done better. I could have done better. No. No. - Give your body time to heal. You ruined me. How long until I\\'m... Dr. Strange... those tissues are still healing. So speed it up. Pass the stent under the brachial artery under the radial artery. It\\'s possible. Experimental and expensive, but possible. All I need is possible. Up. Up. Show me your strength. Ah! It\\'s useless. - It\\'s not useless, man, you can do this. Then answer me this, bachelor\\'s degree. Have you ever known anyone with nerve damage this severe to do this, and actually recover? One guy, yeah. Factory accident, broke  his back. Paralyzed. His leg wasted away. He had pain in his shoulder from the wheelchair. He came in 3 times a week. But one day he stopped coming. I thought he was dead. A few years later, he walked past me on the street. He walked? - Yeah, he walked. - Bullshit. Show me his file. It can take me a while to pull the files from the archive. But if it proves your arrogant ass wrong, it\\'s worth it. I looked at all your research. I read all the papers you\\'ve sent, but... none will work. I... I don\\'t think you realize how severe the damage is, I... Look, here\\'s the thing, I... - At best, I\\'d try and fail. Look, I understand. Here\\'s the thing. I... What you want from me is impossible, Stephen. - Come on... I\\'ve got my own reputation to consider. - Etienne, wait. I can\\'t help you... - No. No, no, wait! Hi. He won\\'t do it. He\\'s a hack. There\\'s a new procedure in Tokyo. They culture donor stem cells and then harvest them and 3D-print a scaffold. If I could get a loan together, just... Stephen... - A small loan, 200,000. Stephen. You\\'ve always spent money as fast as you could make it but now you\\'re spending money you don\\'t even have. Maybe it\\'s time to consider stopping. No. Now is exactly the time not to stop. Because, you see, I\\'m not getting any better! But this isn\\'t medicine anymore. This is mania. Some things just can\\'t be fixed. Life without my work... - Is still life. This isn\\'t the end. There are other things that can give your life meaning. Like what? Like you? And this is the part where you apologize. This is the part where you leave. Fine. I can\\'t watch you do this to yourself anymore. Too difficult for you, is it? - Yes. It is. And it breaks my heart to see you this way. - No. Don\\'t pity me.  I\\'m not pitying you. - Oh yeah? Then what are you doing here? Bringing cheese and wine as if we\\'re old friends going for a picnic? We are not friends, Christine. We were barely lovers. You just love a sob story, don\\'t you? Is that what I am to you now? Poor Stephen Strange, charity case. He finally needs me. Another dreg of humanity for you to work on. Fix him up and send him back into the world, heart is just humming... You care so much! Don\\'t you?!? Goodbye, Stephen. Told you so! Pangborn, J. Metropolitan General Hospital Come on, man! Where is the competition? You talk a lot! Jonathan Pangborn, C7-C8 spinal cord injury, complete. Who are you? - Paralyzed from the mid-chest down. Partial paralysis of both hands. I don\\'t know you. I\\'m Stephen Strange. I\\'m a neurosurgeon. Was a neurosurgeon. Actually, you know what, man? I think I know you. I came to your office once. You refused to see me. I never got past your assistant. You were untreatable. - No glory for you in that, right? You came back from a place there is no way back from! I... I\\'m trying to find my own way back. Hey, Pangborn, you in it or not? Alright. I\\'d given up on my body. I thought my mind was the only thing I had left. I should at least try to elevate that. So I sat with gurus, and sacred women. Strangers carried me to mountain tops to see holy men. And finally, I found my teacher. And my mind was elevated. And my spirit deepened. And somehow... - Your body healed. - Yes. And there were deeper secrets to learn then, but I did not have the strength to receive them. I chose to settle for my miracle, and I came back home. The place you\\'re looking for is called Kamar-Taj. But the cost is high. - How much? I\\'m not talking about money. Good luck.  Give me the ball! Kathmandu, Nepal Excuse me. Kamar-Taj? Do you know where Kamar-Taj is? Sign: \"Himalayan Healing! Find Peace! Find Yourself!\" Kamar-Taj? Kamar-Taj... Okay. Guys, I... I don\\'t have any money. - Your watch. No, please. It\\'s all I have left. - Your watch. Alright. You\\'re looking for Kamar-Taj? Really? Are you sure you got the right place? That one looks a little more... Kamar-y Taj-y. I once stood in your place. And I, too, was... disrespectful. So might I offer you some advice? Forget everything you think you know. Uh... alright. The sanctuary of our teacher. The Ancient One. The Ancient One? What\\'s his real name? Right. Forget everything I think I know. I\\'m sorry. Thank you for... huh! Okay, that\\'s, uh... a thing... Thank you. Hello. Uh, thank you. And thank you. Uh, thank you, Ancient One... for... seeing me... You\\'re very welcome. The Ancient One. - Thank you, Master Mordo. Thank you, Master Hamir! Mr. Strange! Doctor, actually. - Well, no. Not anymore, surely. Isn\\'t that why you\\'re here? You\\'ve undergone many procedures. Seven, right? - Yeah... Good tea. Did you heal a man named Pangborn? A paralyzed man. In a way. - You helped him to walk again. Yes. - How do you correct a complete C7-C8 spinal cord injury? Oh, I didn\\'t correct it. He couldn\\'t walk; I convinced him that he could. You\\'re not suggesting it was psychosomatic? When you reattach a severed nerve, is it you who heals it back together or the body? It\\'s the cells. - And the cells are only programmed to put themselves together in very specific ways. That\\'s right. - What if I told you that your own body could be convinced to put itself back together in all sorts of ways? You\\'re talking about cellular regeneration. That\\'s... bleeding-edge medical tech.  Is that why you\\'re working here, without a governing medical board? I mean... just how experimental is your treatment? Quite. So, you figured out a way to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal? No, Mr. Strange. I know how to reorient the spirit to better heal the body. Spirit... to heal the body. Huh. A... Al... Al... alright. How do we do that? Where do we start? Don\\'t like that map? Oh, no. It\\'s... it\\'s very good. It\\'s just... you know, I\\'ve seen it before. In gift shops. And what about this one? - Acupuncture, great. - Yeah? What about... that one? You\\'re showing me an MRI scan? I can not believe this. Each of those maps was drawn up by someone who could see in part, but not the whole. I spent my last dollar getting here on a one-way ticket, and you\\'re talking to me about healing through belief? You\\'re a man who\\'s looking at the world through a keyhole, and you spent your whole life trying to widen that keyhole. To see more, know more. And now, on hearing that it can be widened in ways you can\\'t imagine, you reject the possibility? No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales about chakras, or energy, or the power of belief. There is no such thing as spirit! We are made of matter, and nothing more. We\\'re just another tiny, momentary speck within an indifferent universe. You think too little of yourself. - Oh, you think you see through me, do you? Well, you don\\'t. But I see through you!!! What did you just do to me?!? - I pushed your astral form out of your physical form. What\\'s in that tea? Psilocybin? LSD? Just tea. With a little honey. What just happened? - For a moment, you entered the astral dimension. What?? - A place where the soul exists apart from the body. Why are you doing this to me?  - To show you just how much you don\\'t know. Open your eye. No! No... No! Shit! Oh god! Oh god! Oh god! This isn\\'t real it isn\\'t real it isn\\'t His heart rate are getting dangerously high. He looks alright to me. You think you know how the world works? You think that this material universe is all there is? What is real? What mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses? At the root of existence, mind and matter meet. Thoughts shape reality. This universe is only one of an infinite number. Worlds without end. Some benevolent and life-giving; Others filled with malice and hunger. Dark places, where powers older than time lie... ravenous... and waiting. Who are you in this vast multiverse, Mr. Strange? Have you seen that before in a gift shop? Teach me! No. No... No! No, no, no, no no no no! No! Open the door! Please! Thank you, Masters. You think I\\'m wrong to cast him out? 5 hours later, he\\'s still on your doorstep. There\\'s a strength to him. Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition... I\\'ve seen it all before. He reminds you of Kaecilius? I can not lead another gifted student to power, only to lose him to the darkness. You didn\\'t lose me. I wanted the power to defeat my enemies. You gave me the power to defeat my demons. And to live within the natural law. We never lose our demons, Mordo. We only learn to live above them. Kaecilius still has the stolen pages. If he deciphers them, he could bring ruin upon us all. There may be dark days ahead. Perhaps Kamar-Taj could use a man like Strange. Don\\'t shut me out. I\\'ve nowhere else to go. Thank you. Bed. Rest. Meditate... if you can. The Ancient One will send for you. Uh, what\\'s this? My mantra? The Wi-Fi password. We\\'re not savages. Time will tell how much I love you.  - Christine The language of the mystic arts is as old as civilization. The sorcerers of antiquity called the use of this language \"spells\". But if that word offends your modern sensibilities, you can call it \"program\". The source code that shapes reality. We harness energy drawn from other dimensions of the multiverse, to cast spells, conjure shields and weapons to make magic. But... even if my fingers could do that, My hands would just be waving in the air. I mean, how do I get from here to there? How did you get to reattach severed nerves, and put a human spine back together bone by bone? Study and practice. Years of it. Hey. Mr. Strange. - Uh... Stephen, please. - And you are? - Wong. - Wong. Just Wong? Like... Adele? Or... Aristotle. Drake. Bono. Eminem. The book of the invisible sun. Astronomia Nova. Codex Imperium. Key of Solomon. You finished all of this? - Yup. Come with me. - Alright. This section is for Masters only. But at my discretion, others may use it. We should start with Maxim\\'s Primer. How is your Sanskrit? I\\'m fluent in Google Translate. Read it. Classical Sanskrit. What are those? The Ancient One\\'s private collection. So they\\'re forbidden? No knowledge in Kamar-Taj is forbidden. Only certain practices. Those books are far too advanced for anyone other than the Sorcerer Supreme. This one\\'s got pages missing. That\\'s the book of Cagliostro. The study of time. One of the rituals was stolen by a former Master. A zealot called Kaecilius. Just after he strung up the former librarian, and relieved him of his head. I\\'m now the guardian of these books. So if a volume from this collection should be stolen again, I\\'d know it. And you\\'d be dead before you ever left the compound.  What if it\\'s just overdue? You know? Any... late fees I should know about? Maybe, perhaps, uhm... Uh, you know, people used to think that I was funny. Did they work for you? Alright. Well, it\\'s been lovely talking to you, thank you for the books and for the horrifying story and for the threat upon my life. Now we receive the power to destroy the one who betrayed us. The one who betrays the world. Mastery of the sling ring is essential to the mystic arts. They allow us to travel throughout the multiverse. All you need to do is focus. Visualize. See the destination in your mind. Look beyond the world in front of you. Imagine every detail. The clearer the picture, the quicker, and easier, the gateway will come. And stop. I\\'d like a moment alone with Mr. Strange. Of course. My hands. - It\\'s not about your hands. How is this not about my hands? Master Hamir. Thank you, Master Hamir. You cannot beat a river into submission. You have to surrender to its current, and use its power as your own. I... I control it by surrendering control? That doesn\\'t make any sense. Not everything does. Not everything has to. Your intellect has taken you far in life. But it will take you no further. Surrender, Stephen. Silence your ego and your power will rise. Come with me. Wait. Is this... - Everest. It\\'s beautiful. - Yeah, you\\'re right. Beautiful. It\\'s freezing, but... beautiful. At this temperature, a person can last for 13 minutes before suffering permanent loss of function. - Great. But you will likely go into shock within the first 2 minutes. - What? Surrender, Stephen. - No, no!!! Don\\'t! How is our new recruit? - We shall see. Any second now. No, not again. Maybe I should... Stephen. - Wong. What do you want, Strange?  - Books on astral projection. You\\'re not ready for that. - Try me, Beyonc. Come on. You\\'ve heard of her. She\\'s a huge star, right? Do you ever laugh? Oh come on, just give me the book, huh? No. Once, in this room, you begged me to let you learn. Now I\\'m told you question every lesson, prefering to teach yourself. Once, in this room, you told me to open my eyes. Now I\\'m being told to blindly accept rules that make no sense. Like the rule against conjuring a gateway in the library? Wong told on me? - You\\'re advancing quickly with your sorcery skills. You need a safe space to practice your spells. You are now inside the Mirror Dimension. Ever present but undetected. The real world isn\\'t affected by what happens here. We use the Mirror Dimension to train, surveil, and sometimes to contain threats. You don\\'t want to be stuck in here without your sling ring. Hold on. Sorry, what do you mean, threats? Learning of an infinite multiverse included learning of infinite dangers. And if I told you everything else that you don\\'t already know, you\\'d run from here in terror. So, just how ancient is she? No one knows the age of the Sorcerer Supreme. Only that she is Celtic and never talks about her past. You follow her even though you don\\'t know? I know that she\\'s steadfast, but unpredictable. Merciless, yet kind. She made me what I am. Trust your teacher. And don\\'t lose your way. Like Kaecilius? - That\\'s right. You knew him. When he first came to us, he\\'d lost everyone he ever loved. He was a grieving and broken man, searching for answers in the mystic arts. A brilliant student, but he was proud, headstrong. Questioned the Ancient One, rejected our teaching. He left Kamar-Taj. His disciples followed him like sheep  seduced by false doctrine. He stole the forbidden ritual, right? - Yeah. What did it do? No more questions. What\\'s that? - That\\'s a question. This is a relic. Some magic is too powerful to sustain, so we imbue objects with it. Allowing them to take the strain we can not. This is the Staff of the Living Tribunal. There are many relics. The Wand of Watoomb. The Bolting Boots of Voltor. They just roll of the tongue, don\\'t they? When do I get my relic? When you\\'re ready. - I think I\\'m ready. You\\'re ready when the relic decides you\\'re ready. For now, conjure a weapon. Yeah. Fight! Fight like your life depended on it! Because one day, it may. Christine I\\'m emailing you one more time to Wong? Okay. First, open the Eye of Agamotto. Alright. Oh my. Dormammu. The Dark Dimension. Eternal life? Stop!!! Tampering with the continuum of probability is forbidden! I... I wa... I was just doing exactly what it said in the book! And what did the book say about the dangers of performing that ritual? Yeah, I don\\'t know. I hadn\\'t gotten to that part yet. Temporal manipulations can create branches in time. Unstable dimensional openings. Spacious paradoxes! Time loops!!! You want to get stuck reliving the same moment over, and over, forever, or never having existed at all? They really should put the warnings before that stuff. Your curiosity could have gotten you killed. You weren\\'t manipulating the space-time continuum, you were wrecking it. We do not tamper with natural law. We defend it. How did you learn to do that? Where did you learn the litany of spells required to even understand it? I\\'ve got a photographic memory. It\\'s how I got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time. What you just did takes more than a good memory.  You were born for the mystic arts. And yet, my hands still shake. - For now, yes. Not forever? - We\\'re not prophets. When do you start telling me what we are? While heroes like the Avengers protect the world from physical dangers, we sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats. The Ancient One is the latest in a long line of Sorcerers Supreme Going back thousands of years to the father of the mystic arts, the mighty Agamotto. The same sorcerer who created the eye you so recklessly borrowed. Agamotto built 3 Sanctums in places of power, where great cities now stand. That door leads to the Hong Kong Sanctum, that door to the New York Sanctum. That one, to the London Sanctum. Together, the Sanctums generate a protective shield around our world. The Sanctums protect the world, and we sorcerers protect the Sanctums. - From what? Other-dimensional beings that threaten our universe. Like Dormammu? Where did you learn that name? I just read it in the book of Cagliostro. Why? Dormammu dwells in the Dark Dimension. Beyond time. He is the cosmic conquerer, the destroyer of worlds. A being of infinite power and endless hunger, on a quest to invade every universe and bring all worlds into his Dark Dimension. And he hungers for Earth most of all. The pages that Kaecilius stole. A ritual to contact Dormammu and draw power from the Dark Dimension. Uuuh... okay. Okay. I... time-out. I... I came here to heal my hands, not to fight in some mystical war. London. Kaecilius! No!!! Wong? Mordo? 177A Bleecker Street Hello? Hello? Daniel. I see they made you Master of the Sanctum. Do you know what that means? That you\\'ll die protecting it. Stop! How long have you been at Kamar-TaJ, Mister...? Doctor. - Just Doctor? - It\\'s Strange.  Maybe. Who am I to judge? You don\\'t know how to use that, do you? What? You\\'ll die here. - Oh, stop it. I said, stop it! You cannot stop this, Mr. Doctor. - Why... look, I don\\'t even know what \"this\" is. It\\'s the end and the beginning. The many becoming the few, becoming the One. Look, if you\\'re not going to start making sense, I\\'m just going to have to put this thing back on. Tell me, Mr. Doctor. Alright, look. My name is Dr. Stephen Strange. You are a doctor? - Yes. - A scientist. You understand the laws of nature. All things age. All things die. In the end, our sun burns out, our universe grows cold and perishes. But the Dark Dimension... it\\'s a place beyond time. That\\'s it. I\\'m putting this thing back on. This world doesn\\'t have to die, Doctor. This world can take its rightful place among so many others, as part of the One. The great and beautiful One. And we can all live forever. Really? What do you have to gain out of this New Age dimensional utopia? The same as you. The same as everyone. Life. Eternal life. People think in terms of good and evil, but really, time is the true enemy of us all. Time kills everything. What about the people you killed? Tiny, momentary specks within an indifferent universe. Yes. You see, you see what we\\'re doing? The world is not what it ought to be. Humanity longs for the eternal, for a world beyond time, because time is what enslaves us. Time is an insult. Death is an insult. Doctor... We don\\'t seek to rule this world. We seek to save it, to hand it over to Dormammu, who is the intent of all evolution, the Why of all existence. The Sorcerer Supreme defends existence. What was it that brought you to Kamar-Taj, Doctor? Was it enlightenment? Power? You came to be healed, as did we all.  Kamar-Taj is a place that collects broken things. We all come with the promise of being healed, but instead, the Ancient One gives us parlor tricks. The real magic she keeps for herself. Have you ever wondered how she managed to live this long? I... I saw the rituals in the book of Cagliostro. So, you know. The ritual gives me the power to overthrow the Ancient One and tear her Sanctums down, to let the Dark Dimension in. Because what the Ancient One hoards, Dormammu gives freely. Life, everlasting. He is not the destroyer of worlds, Doctor, he is the savior of worlds. No. I mean, come on. Look at your face. Dormammu made you a murderer. Just how good can his kingdom be? You think that\\'s funny? No. No, Doctor. What\\'s funny is that you\\'ve lost your sling ring. Sir, can I help you? - Dr. Palmer, where is she? Sir, we need to... - Where is she? - At the nurses station. Christine! Stephen? Oh my god. What... - We need to get me on an operation table now. Just you. Now! I don\\'t have any time! What happened? - Stabbed. Cardiac tamponade. What are you wearing? The chest cavity is clear. - The blood... is in the pericardial sac. No. No no no no no no no! Stephen! Stephen! Just a little higher. Please be careful with the needle. Stephen? Oh lord, oh lord. What am I seeing? - My astral body. Are you dead? - No, Christine, but I am dying. Right. Right. Yeah. Alright. I\\'ve... I\\'ve never seen a wound like this before. What were you stabbed with? I don\\'t know. I\\'m going to have to vanish now. - No, I... Keep me alive, will you? Okay! Okay. Oh shit! Charging to 200 Joule Stephen, come on. Hit me again! - Stop doing that! Up the voltage and hit me again. No, your heart is beating! - Just do it!  Oh god! Are you ok? - Hey there. Okay. After all this time, you just show up here, flying out of your body? - Yeah, I know. I missed you too, by the way. I wrote 2 emails, but you never responded. Why would I? Christine, I am so, so sorry. For all of it. And you were right, I was a complete asshole. I treated you so horribly and you deserved so much more. - Stop. You... you\\'re clearly in shock. I mean, what the hell is happening? Where have you been? Well, after Western medicine failed me, I headed East, and I ended up in Kathmandu. Kathmandu? - Yeah. What, like the Bob Seger song? - 1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. And then, I went to a place called Kamar-Taj and I talked to someone called the Ancient One, and... Oh. So you joined a cult. - No, I didn\\'t. Not exactly. I mean, they did teach me to tap into powers that I never even knew existed. Yeah, that sounds like a cult. - It\\'s not a cult. Well, that\\'s what a cultist would say. - Oh, no. Wait, Stephen... what do you think you\\'re doing? I\\'m late for a cult meeting. This is insane. - Yeah. Where are you going? Uhm... - Just tell me the truth? Well, a powerful sorcerer, who gave himself over to an ancient entity who can bend the very laws of physics, tried very hard to kill me, but I left him chained up in Greenwich Village, and the quickest way back there is through a dimensional gateway that I opened up in the mop closet. - Okay. Don\\'t tell me. Fine. I really do have to go. Strange! You\\'re okay. - A relative term, but yeah, I\\'m okay. The Cloak of Levitation. It came to you. No minor feat. It\\'s a fickle thing. He\\'s escaped. - Kaecilius? - Yeah. He can fold space and matter at will. He folds matter outside the mirror dimension? In the real world? - Yeah.  How many more? - Two. I stranded one in the desert. - And the other? - His body was in the hall. Master Drumm was in the foyer. - He\\'s been taken back to Kamar-Taj. The London Sanctum has fallen. Only New York and Hong Kong remain now to shield us from the Dark Dimension. You defended the New York Sanctum from attack. With its Master gone, it needs another, Master Strange. No. It is Dr. Strange. Not Master Strange, not Mr. Strange, Doctor Strange. When I became a doctor, I swore an oath to do no harm. And I have just killed a man! I\\'m not doing that again. I became a doctor to save lives, not take them. You become a doctor to save one life above all others. Your own. Still seeing through me, are you? - I see what I\\'ve always seen. Your overinflated ego. You want to go back to the delusion that you can control anything, even death, which no one can control. Not even the great doctor Stephen Strange. Not even Dormammu? He offers immortality. It\\'s our fear of death that gives Dormammu life. He feeds off it. - Like you feed on him? You talk to me about controlling death. Well, I know how you do it. I\\'ve seen the missing rituals from the book of Cagliostro. Measure your next words very carefully, doctor. Because you might not like them? Because you may not know of what you speak. What is he talking about? - I\\'m talking about her long life. The source of her immortality. She draws power from the Dark Dimension to stay alive. That\\'s not true. - I\\'ve seen the rituals and worked them out. I know how you do it. Once they regroup, the zealots will be back. You\\'ll need reinforcements. She is not who you think she is. - You don\\'t have the right to say that. You have no idea of the responsibility that rests upon her shoulders.  - No, and I don\\'t want to know. You\\'re a coward. - Because I\\'m not a killer? - These zealots will snuff us all out, and you can muster the strength to snuff them out first? What do you think I just did? - You saved your own life! And then whined about it like a wounded dog. - When you would have done it so easily? You have no idea. The things I\\'ve done... And the answer is yes. Without hesitation. - Even if there\\'s another way? There is no other way. - You lack imagination. No, Stephen. You lack a spine. They\\'re back. We have to end this. Now! Strange! Get down here and fight! The Mirror Dimension. You can\\'t affect the real world in here. Who\\'s laughing now, asshole? I am. They\\'ve got no sling ring. I mean, they can\\'t escape, right? Run! Their connection to the Dark Dimension makes them more powerful in the Mirror Dimension. They can\\'t affect the real world, but they can still kill us. This wasn\\'t clever. This was suicide! That is hilarious. This was a mistake. It\\'s true. She does draw power from the Dark Dimension. Kaecilius. I came to you, broken, lost, bleeding. I trusted you to be my teacher, and you fed me lies. I tried to protect you. - From the truth? - From yourself. I have a new teacher now. - Dormammu deceives you. You have no idea of what he truly is. His eternal life is not paradise, but torment. - Liar. Christine!!! - Are you kidding me? Oh my god. No fibrillation... It\\'s neurogenic? - Yes. Nick? We need to relieve the pressure on her brain. She still drops. - We\\'re losing her! - You need to increase her oxygen! I need a crash cart! - Her pupils are dilated! No reflexes. I\\'m not reading any brain activity. What are you doing? You\\'re dying! You have to return to your body now.  You don\\'t have time. Time is relative. Your body hasn\\'t even hit the floor yet. I\\'ve spent so many years peering through time, looking at this exact moment. But I can\\'t see past it. I\\'ve prevented countless terrible futures. And after each one, there\\'s always another. And they all lead here, but never further. - You think this is where you die. Do you wonder what I see in your future? - No. Yes. - I never saw your future. Only its possibilities. You have such a capacity for goodness. You always excelled, but not because you crave success, but because of your fear of failure. It\\'s what made me a great doctor. It\\'s precisely what kept you from greatness. Arrogance and fear still keep you from learning the simplest and most significant lesson of all. Which is? It\\'s not about you. When you first came to me, you asked me how I was able to heal Jonathan Pangborn. I didn\\'t. He channels dimensional energy directly into his own body. He uses magic to walk. - Constantly. He had a choice, to return to to his own life or to serve something greater than himself. So, I could have my hands back again? My old life? You could. And the world would be all the lesser for it. I\\'ve hated drawing power from the Dark Dimension. But as you well know, sometimes one must break the rules in order to serve the greater good. - Mordo won\\'t see it that way. Mordo\\'s soul is rigid and unmovable, forged by the fires of his youth. He needs your flexibility, just as you need his strength. Only together do you stand a chance of stopping Dormammu. I\\'m not ready. No one ever is. We don\\'t get to choose our time. Death is what gives life meaning. To know your days are numbered, your time is short. You\\'d think after all this time I\\'d be ready.  But look at me, stretching one moment out into a thousand, just so I can watch the snow. Are you okay? I don\\'t understand what\\'s happening. - I know. But I have to go right now. You said that losing my hands didn\\'t have to be the end, that it could be a beginning. - Yeah. Because there are other ways to save lives. A harder way. A weirder way. Dr. Palmer, the ER, please. Dr. Palmer, the ER. I don\\'t want to let you go. Stop. Hong Kong Choose your weapon wisely. No one steps foot in this Sanctum. No one. Kaecilius. - You\\'re on the wrong side of history, Wong. She\\'s dead. - You were right. She wasn\\'t who I thought she was. She was complicated. Complicated? The Dark Dimension is volatile. Dangerous. What if it overtook her? She taught us it was forbidden, while she drew on its power to steal centuries of life. She did what she thought was right. The bill comes due. Don\\'t you see? Her transgressions led the zealots to Dormammu. Kaecilius was her fault. And here we are, in the consequence of her deception. A world on fire. - Mordo, London Sanctum has fallen. And New York has been attacked. Twice. You know where they\\'re going next. Hong Kong. - You told me once to fight as if my life depended on it, because one day, it might. Well, today is that day. I can not defeat them alone. The Sanctum has already fallen. The Dark Dimension. Dormammu is coming. It\\'s too late. Nothing can stop him. Not necessarily. No. Spells working. We got a second chance. No! Wong! I\\'m breaking the laws of nature, I know. Well, don\\'t stop now. When the Sanctum is restored, they will attack again. We have to defend it. Come on! Get up, Strange. Get up and fight! We will finish this. You can\\'t fight the inevitable. Isn\\'t it beautiful?  A world beyond time. Beyond death. Beyond time... Strange! He\\'s gone. Stephen Strange has left to surrender to his power. Dormammu! I\\'ve come to bargain. You\\'ve come to die. Your world is now my world, like all worlds. Dormammu! I\\'ve come to bargain. You\\'ve come to die. Your world is now my world... What is this? Illusion? - No, this is real. - Good. Dormammu! I\\'ve come to bargain. You... what is happening? Just as you gave Kaecilius powers from your dimension, I\\'ve brought a little power from mine. This is time. An endless looped time. You dare! Dormammu! I\\'ve come to bargain. You cannot do this forever. Actually, I can. This is how things are now. You and me, trapped in this moment, endlessly. Then you will spend eternity dying. Yeah. But everyone on Earth will live. But you will suffer. Pain is an old friend. Dormammu! I\\'ve come to bargain. - End this! Dormammu!... Dormammu!... Dormammu!... You will never win. No... But I can lose. Again, and again, and again, and again, forever. And that makes you my prisoner. - No. Stop! Make this stop!!! Set me free! - No. I\\'ve come to bargain. Oh, what do you want? Take your zealots from the Earth. End your assault on my world. Never come back. Do it, and I\\'ll break the loop. Get up, Strange. Get up and fight! We will finish this. Isn\\'t it beautiful? A world beyond time. Beyond death. What have you done? - I made a bargain. What is this? - Well, it\\'s, uh... it\\'s everything you ever wanted. Eternal life as part of the One. You\\'re not going to like it. I think he really should have stolen the whole book, because the warnings... the warnings come after the spells. Oh, that\\'s funny. We did it. Yes. Yes, we did it. By also violating the natural laws. Look around you. It\\'s over.  You still think there will be no consequences, Strange? No price to pay? We broke our rules, just like her. The bill comes due. Always. A reckoning. I will follow this path no longer. Yeah, it\\'s okay. Wise choice. You\\'ll wear the eye of Agamotto once you\\'ve mastered its powers. Until then, best not to walk the streets wearing an infinity stone. A what? - You have a gift for the mystic arts, but you still have much to learn. Word of the Ancient One\\'s death will spread through the multiverse. The Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme to defend it. We must be ready. - We\\'ll be ready. So, Earth has wizards now, huh? Tea? - I don\\'t drink tea. What do you drink? Not tea. So, I keep a watchlist of individuals and beings from other realms that may be a threat to this world. Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings. A worthy inclusion. - Yeah. So, why bring him here to New York? That\\'s a long story. A family drama, that kind of thing, but... we\\'re looking for my father. Oh, okay. So, if you\\'ve found Odin, you all will return to Asgard, probably? Oh, yes. Probably. - Alright. Let me help you. Can I help you? They carried you into Kamar-Taj on a strecher. Look at you now. - Pangborn. - Mordo. So, what can I do for you? Man! You been away many months now and I heard a revelation. The true purpose of a sorcerer is to twist things out of there proper shape. Stealing power, providing nature... like you. I stolen nothing. This is my power. Mine. Power... has a purpose. Why you doing this? Because I see it long last was wrong with the world. Too many sorcerers. '],\n",

Bring it and we shall gladly be on our way.\\n [The Sovereign guards bring a hooded figure nto the courtroom and throw her on the ground and pull back her hood, to reveal Gamoras sister, Nebula]\\n Quill: Family reunion. Yay.\\n Ayesha: I understand she is your sister.\\n Gamora: Shes worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar.\\n Ayesha: Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries. Do with her as you please.\\n Quill: We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.\\n Ayesha: What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?\\n Quill: My mother is from Earth.\\n Ayesha: And your father?\\n Quill: He aint from Missouri. Thats all I know.\\n Ayesha: I see it within you. An unorthodox genealogy. A hybrid that seems particularly reckless.\\n Rocket: [after hearing Ayesha insulted Peter] You know, they told me you people were conceited douchebags, but that isnt true at all. [Winks] Oh, shit. Im using my wrong eye again, arent I? Im sorry. [Drax picks Rocket up from the scruff of his vest and carries him briefly] That was meant to be behind your back. [Drax puts Rocket down]\\n Drax: Count yourself blessed they didnt kill you.\\n Rocket: Youre telling me. [shows Drax the batteries] You wanna buy some batteries? [Drax laughs out loud but Rocket quickly shushes him. On The Milano, \"Lake Shore Drive\" plays] All right, lets get baldy to Xandar and collect that bounty.\\n Quill: That stuff about my father Who does she think she is?\\n Gamora: I know youre sensitive about that.\\n Quill: Im not sensitive about it. I just dont know who he is. Sorry if it seemed like I was flirting with the High Priestess. I wasnt.\\n Gamora: I dont care if you were.\\n Quill: Well, I feel like you do care. Thats why Im apologizing. So, sorry!\\n Drax: Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.\\n Quill: Damn shadow.\\n Drax: There are two types of beings in the universe those who dance, and those who do not.\\n Quill: Mmm-hmm.\\n Drax: I first met my beloved at a war rally.\\n Quill: Oh, God.\\n Drax: Everyone in the village flailed about, dancing. Except one woman. My Ovette. I knew immediately she was the one for me. The most melodic song in the world could be playing. She wouldnt even tap her foot. Wouldnt move a muscle. One might assume she was dead.\\n Quill: That does sound pretty hot.\\n Drax: It would make my nether regions engorge.\\n Quill: Okay. I get it, yes. Im a dancer, Gamora is not.\\n Drax: You just need to find a woman who is pathetic like you.\\n Quill: Mmm.\\n Nebula: Im hungry. Hand me some of that yaro root.\\n Gamora: No. Its not ripe yet and I hate you.\\n Nebula: You hate me? You left me there while you stole that stone for yourself. And yet here you stand, a hero. I will be free of these shackles soon enough, and I will kill you. I swear.\\n Gamora: No. Youre gonna live out the rest of your days in a prison on Xandar wishing you could.\\n Quill: This is weird, we got a Sovereign fleet approaching from the rear.\\n Gamora: Why would they do that?\\n Drax: Probably cause Rocket stole some of their batteries.\\n Rocket: Dude!\\n Drax: [awkwardly] Right he didnt steal some of those. I dont know why theyre after us, what a mystery this is.\\n Quill: What were you thinking?\\n Rocket: Dude, they were really easy to steal!\\n Gamora: Thats your defense?\\n Rocket: Come on! You saw how that High Priestess talked down to us. Now Im teaching her a lesson!\\n Quill: I didnt realize your motivation was altruism. Its really a shame the Sovereigns mistaking your intentions and theyre trying to kill us.\\n Rocket: Exactly.\\n Quill: I was being sarcastic!\\n Rocket: Oh, no! Youre supposed to use a sarcastic voice! Now I look foolish!\\n Gamora: Can your bickering on a hold until after we survive this massive space battle?\\n Quill: More incoming!\\n Rocket: Good, I want to kill some guys!\\n Sovereign Woman: Damn it!\\n Ayesha: What is the delay, Admiral?\\n Sovereign Admiral: High Priestess, the batteries, they are exceptionally combustible and could destroy the entire fleet.\\n Ayesha: Our concern is their slight against our people. We hired them and they steal from us. It is heresy of the highest order.\\n Sovereign Admiral: All command modules fire with the intent to kill.\\n Quill: Whats the nearest habitable planet?\\n Gamora: Its called Berhert.\\n Quill: How many jumps?\\n Gamora: Only one. But the access point is 47 clicks away. And you have to go through that quantum asteroid field.\\n Drax: Quill, to make it through that youd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.\\n Quill: Lucky for us, I\\n Rocket: I am. What are you doing?\\n Quill: Ive been flying this rig since I was 10 years old.\\n Rocket: I was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft.\\n Quill: You were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag!\\n Gamora: Stop it.\\n Rocket: Later on tonight, youre gonna be laying down, theres gonna be something squishy in your pillowcase. And youre gonna be like, \"whats this?\", and its gonna be because I put a turd in there.\\n Quill: You put your turd in my bed and I shave you!\\n Rocket: Oh, it wont be my turd. Itll be Draxs.\\n Drax: [laughs] I have famously huge turds!\\n Gamora: Were about to die, and this is what were discussing?\\n Rocket: Son of a\\n Quill: Dude! Seriously!\\n Rocket: Hey! Let me\\n Nebula: Idiots!\\n Rocket: [smiles] Well, thats what you get when Quill flies.\\n [Gamora throws something at Rocket]\\n Gamora: We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.\\n Quill: Our weapons are down.\\n Gamora: 20 clicks to the jump! Hold on.\\n [Nebula tries to steal another fruit, but Drax kicks it out of her grasp.]\\n Drax: Its not ripe.\\n [In Sovereign control, Zylak is one of the few ones controlling a droid.]\\n Zylak\\'s Frenemy Come on, Zylak. You can do this.\\n All Sovereign: Yes!\\n [In the Milano cockpit]\\n Gamora: 15 clicks to the jump!\\n All Sovereign: Come on! Keep going!\\n Gamora: 10 clicks!\\n Drax: Die, spaceship!\\n [Drax hits the ship with his shot and destroys Zylak\\'s ship]\\n Sovereign: You suck, Zylak.\\n Sovereign Woman: Typical.\\n Gamora: Five clicks!\\n Quill: Son of a They went around the field!\\n Sovereign General: Someone destroyed all our ships!\\n Ayesha: What? Who?\\n Gamora: One click!\\n Rocket: What is that?\\n Quill: Who cares? Thats the jump point! Go!\\n Rocket: Its a guy.\\n Gamora: [noticing Drax is still out there] Oh, my God. Hes still out there?\\n Quill: Groot, put your seatbelt on! Prepare for a really bad landing!\\n Drax: [laughing] That was awesome! Yes!\\n [All the Guardians are out of their ship and notice the Milano is destroyed.]\\n Gamora: Look at this! Where is the other half of our ship?\\n Quill: My ship.\\n Gamora: Either one of you could have gotten us through that field had you flown with whats between your ears instead of whats between your legs!\\n Quill: If whats between my legs had a hand on it I guarantee I could have landed this ship with it.\\n Gamora: [in a scolding tone] Peter, we almost died because of your arrogance.\\n Quill: More like because he stole the Anulax batteries!\\n Drax: Theyre called Harbulary batteries.\\n Quill: No, theyre not!\\n Rocket: Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch? Hmm?\\n Quill: I\\'m not gonna answer to \"Star-Munch.\"\\n Rocket: I did it because I wanted to!\\n Quill: Dick.\\n Rocket: What are we even talking about this for? We just had a little man save us by blowing up fifty ships!\\n Drax: How little?\\n Rocket: [holding his thumb and forefinger close together] Well, I don\\'t know, like this?\\n Gamora: [skeptically] A little one-inch man saved us?\\n Rocket: Well, if he got closer, I\\'m sure he would be much larger.\\n Quill: It\\'s how eyesight works, you stupid raccoon.\\n Rocket: Don\\'t call me a racoon!\\n Quill: I\\'m sorry. I took it too far. I meant trash panda.\\n [Rocket looks around in confusion]\\n Rocket: Is that better?\\n Drax: I don\\'t know.\\n Quill: [snickering] It\\'s worse. It\\'s so much worse.\\n Rocket: You son of a\\n Quill: Hey!\\n Rocket: Ive had it with you!\\n Quill: No! Back up!\\n Nebula: [notices a ship coming through] Someone followed you through the jump point. Set me free, youll need my help.\\n Gamora: Im not a fool, Nebula.\\n Nebula: You are a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat.\\n Gamora: Youll attack me the moment I let you go.\\n Nebula: [terrible at lying] No, I wont.\\n Quill: Youd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.\\n Drax: I bet its the one-inch man.\\n Ego: After all these years, Ive found you.\\n Peter Quill: And who the hell are you?\\n Ego: I figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious. My name is Ego and Im your dad, Peter.\\n Howard the Duck: You know what they say \"Youre out of luck until youve gone duck.\"\\n Tullk: Yondu! Come on down!\\n Stakar Ogord: After going around years in circles with this woman I end up marrying. I said, \"Aleta, I love you, girl \"but youre losing your mind!\" Then again, shes always been that way. I could never trust her. You know?\\n Yondu Udonta: Stakar. Its been some time.\\n Stakar: It seems like this establishment is the wrong kind of disreputable.\\n Yondu: Stakar!\\n Stakar: Theres a hundred Ravager factions. You lost the business of 99 of them by serving one.\\n Inn Keeper\\'s Wife: Please, sir. Please!\\n Stakar: Get away from me.\\n Yondu: You can go to hell then. I don\\'t give a damn what you think of me.\\n Stakar: So what are you following us for?\"\\n Yondu: Are you gonna listen to what I gotta say?!\\n Stakar: I don\\'t gotta listen to nothing, you betrayed the code. Ravagers don\\'t deal in kids!\\n Yondu: I told you before, I didn\\'t know what was going on...\\n Stakar: You didn\\'t know cause you didn\\'t wanna know cause that made you rich.\\n Yondu: I demand a seat on the table. I wear these flames, same as you!\\n Stakar: You may dress like us, but you\\'ll never hear the hordes of freedom when you die Yondu, and the colors of Ogord will never flash over your grave. If you think I take pleasure in exiling you, you\\'re wrong. You broke all our hearts.\\n Taserface: Ah, pathetic. First, Quill betrays us and Yondu just lets him go scot-free. We followed him because he was the one who wasnt afraid to do what needed to be done. Seems hes goin soft.\\n Kraglin Obfonteri: If hes so soft, why are you whispering?\\n Taserface: You know Im right, Kraglin.\\n Tullk: You best be very careful what you say about our captain.\\n \\'Ravager: [sees Ayesha] Who the hell is that?\\n Ayesha: Yondu Udonta I have a proposition for you.\\n Ego: I hired Yondu to pick you up when your mother passed away. But instead of returning you, Yondu kept you. I have no clue as to why.\\n Quill: Well, Ill tell you why. Because I was a skinny little kid who could squeeze into places adults couldnt. It made it easier for thievin.\\n Ego: Well, Ive been trying to track you down ever since.\\n Drax: I thought Yondu was your father.\\n Quill: What? Weve been together this whole time and you thought Yondu was my actual blood relative?\\n Drax: You look exactly alike.\\n Rocket Raccoon: Ones blue!\\n Peter Quill: No, hes not my father! Yondu was the guy who abducted me, kicked the crap out of me so I could learn to fight, and kept me in terror by threatening to eat me.\\n Ego: Eat you?\\n Peter Quill: Yeah.\\n Ego: Oh, that son of a bitch.\\n Gamora: Howd you locate us now?\\n Ego: Well, even where I reside, out past the edge of whats known weve heard tell about the man they call Star-Lord. What say we head out there right now? Your associates are welcome. Even that triangle-faced monkey there. I promise you its unlike any other place youve ever seen. And there I can explain your very special heritage. Finally get to be the father Ive always wanted to be. Excuse me. Ive gotta take a whiz. [goes to the bathroom; Peter looks at Gamora, still not believing his father]\\n Quill: Im not buying it.\\n Gamora: Lets go take a walk.\\n Mantis: [smiles; to Drax] I am Mantis.\\n Drax: What are you doing?\\n Mantis: Smiling. I hear it is the thing to do to make people like you.\\n Drax: Not if you do it like that.\\n Mantis: Oh I was raised alone on Egos planet. I do not understand the intricacies of social interaction. Can I pet your puppy? It is adorable.\\n Drax: Yes. That is called a practical joke!\\n Mantis: I liked it very much!\\n Drax: I just made it up!\\n Quill: Give me a break! After all this time, youre gonna show up, and all of a sudden you wanna be my dad?\\n Gamora: I hear you.\\n Quill: And by the way, this could be a trap. The Kree purists, the Ravagers they all want us dead.\\n Gamora:I know, but\\n Quill: But what?\\n Gamora: What was that story you once told me about Zardu Hasselfrau?\\n Quill: Who?\\n Gamora: He owned a magic boat?\\n Quill: [long pause] David Hasselhoff?\\n Gamora: Right.\\n Quill: Not a magic boat. A talking car.\\n Gamora: Why did he talk again?\\n Quill: To help him fight crime, and to be supportive!\\n Gamora: As a child, you would carry his picture in your pocket and you would tell all the other children that he was your father, but that he was out of town.\\n Quill: Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany. I told you that when I was drunk. Why are you bringing that up now?\\n Gamora: I love that story.\\n Quill: I hate that story. Its so sad! As a kid, I used to see all the other kids off playing catch with their dad. And I wanted that, more than anything in the world!\\n Gamora: Thats my point, Peter. What if this man is your Hasselhoff? If he ends up being evil we will just kill him.\\n Nebula: Youre leaving me with that fox?\\n Gamora: Hes not a fox. Shoot her if she does anything suspicious. Or if you feel like it.\\n Rocket: Okay.\\n Gamora: [to Groot] Itll be just a couple of days. Well be back before Rockets finished fixing the ship. [Groot gives her a sad smile and wave.]\\n Drax: What if the Sovereign come?\\n Quill: Theres no way for them to know were here. Lets go.\\n Drax: Im uncertain about parting ways.\\n Quill: God, youre like an old woman.\\n Drax: Because Im wise?\\n Gamora: Why do you have so much luggage?\\n Drax: I dont want Groot playing with my things.\\n Rocket: I hope Daddy isnt as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.\\n Quill: What is your goal here? To get everybody to hate you? Because its working.\\n [Quill, Gamora and Drax enter Ego\\'s ship, which immediately takes off.]\\n Quill: Hey, can I ask you a personal question?\\n Mantis: [shocked] Oh No one has ever asked me a personal question.\\n Quill: Your antennas. What are they for?\\n Mantis: Their purpose?\\n Drax: Yes. Quill and I have a bet.\\n Quill: Dude. You\\'re not supposed to say that\\n Drax: I say: if you are about to go through a doorway that is too low, your antennae will feel this, and keep you from being decapitated.\\n Quill: Right, and if it\\'s anything other than specifically not being decapitated by a doorway, I win.\\n Mantis: They are not for feeling doorways! [Drax groans, Peter laughs] I think they have something to do with my empathic abilities.\\n Gamora: What are those?\\n Mantis: If I touch someone, I can feel their feelings.\\n Quill: You read minds?\\n Mantis: No. Telepaths know thoughts. Empaths feel feelings, emotions. May I?\\n Quill: Alright.\\n Mantis: [touches Quill\\'s hand; as she feels his feelings, her antennas lit up] You feel love!\\n Quill: Yeah, I guess I feel a general, unselfish love for just about everybody around me.\\n Mantis: No. Romantic, sexual love\\n Quill: No no, I don\\'t\\n Mantis: For her! [points at Gamora]\\n Quill: No! [Gamora looks surprised] That is not [Drax suddenly starts laughing uproariously] Okay. [Drax continues laughing and points at Peter as he groans] That\\'s\\n Drax: She just told everyone your deepest, darkest secret!\\n Quill: Dude, come on! I think you\\'re overreacting a little bit.\\n Drax: You must be so embarrassed!\\n [Drax continues cackling as Gamora is in amusement]\\n Drax: [to Mantis] Do me! Do me, do me!\\n [She reaches over and touches his chest, and immediately starts laughing along with him]\\n Mantis: I have never felt such humor!\\n [Drax and Mantis are laughing and pointing at Peter]\\n Quill: [to himself] So unbelievably uncool.\\n Drax: [stops laughing] Oh, Quill\\n [Mantis, who is giggling, walks over to Gamora to touch her]\\n Gamora: [suddenly grabs her wrist] Touch me, and the only thing you\\'re gonna feel is a broken jaw. [pause as Mantis looks scared and looks at Gamora, before she finally lets go of Mantis\\' wrist]\\n Mantis: I can also alter emotions to some extent.\\n Peter Quill: Yeah, like what?\\n Mantis: If I touch someone who is sad, I can ease them into contentment for a short while. I can make a stubborn person compliant. But I mostly use it to help my master sleep. He lies awake at night, thinking about his progeny.\\n Drax: Do one of those on me! [Mantis puts her hand on Drax\\'s head]\\n Mantis: Sleep. [Suddenly, Drax immediately falls asleep and snores loudly]\\n [Scene changes to Rocket on Berhert]\\n Rocket: I love this song.\\n Ravager: Aint so tough now without all your toys are you?\\n Rocket: Crap.\\n Yondu: Hey there, rat!\\n Rocket: How\\'s it goin\\', you blue idiot?\\n Yondu: Not so bad! We got ourselves a pretty good little gig here! This golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself has offered us a large sum to deliver you and your pals over to her, because she wants to kill y\\'all.\\n [All the Ravagers laugh; back to the destroyed Milano]\\n Nebula: [to Baby Groot] Your friend There\\'s too many of them. He needs my help. If you care about him You need to get me out of these bonds. They are going to kill him!\\n Yondu: [to Rocket] I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you. I put a tracer on your ship back there during the war over Xandar.\\n Rocket: Give me your word you won\\'t hurt Groot, and I\\'ll tell you where the batteries are.\\n Yondu: [chuckles a little] Lucky for you, my word don\\'t mean squat. Otherwise, I\\'d actually hand you over.\\n Taserface: Otherwise, you\\'d what?\\n Yondu We\\'ll take them batteries! Theyre worth what? A quarter mill on the open market?\\n Taserface: That Priestess offered us a million! A quarter is only one-third of that!\\n Yondu: A quarter ain\\'t a third\\n Gef: A quarter is 25. [Yondu shakes his head]\\n Yondu: No.\\n Gef: We can\\'t even buy a pair of boots with 25 units.\\n Yondu: Enough! The point is, we ain\\'t stupid enough to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy! The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.\\n Kraglin: [off-screen] That ain\\'t right! I just gotta say it this one time, Cap\\'n No matter how many times Quill betrays you, you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!\\n Ravagers: Yeah!!\\n Kraglin: I\\'m the one what sticks up for you!\\n Tullk: Take it easy, Kraglin.\\n Taserface: Damn straight, lad! He\\'s gone soft. Suppose its time for a change in leadership!\\n [All the Ravagers start agreeing as they cock their guns at each other and Yondu prepares to whistle his Yaka arrow; the Ravagers continue to yell and holding their weapons at each other]\\n Tullk: Put your damn guns down!!\\n Rocket: Whoa! Whoa. There must be some kind of peaceful resolution to this, fellas or even a violent one where I\\'m standing over there.\\n [Suddenly, a blast destroys Yondu\\'s control fin, knocking him unconscious, and we see Nebula behind them.]\\n Nebula: Well, hello boys. [takes a bite of the root she\\'s holding; spits it out] Its not ripe.\\n [George Harrison\\'s \"My Sweet Lord\" plays, as the three Guardians, Ego and Mantis leave the ship, and we see the psychedelic landscape of Ego\\'s planet.]\\n Ego: Welcome, everyone, to my world.\\n Quill: Wow. You have your own planet?\\n Ego: Come on. No larger than your Earths Moon.\\n Drax: Humility. I like it. I, too, am extraordinarily humble.\\n Gamora: You own a planet and can destroy two dozen spaceships without a suit. What are you exactly?\\n Ego: Im whats called a Celestial, sweetheart.\\n Quill: A Celestial, like a god?\\n Ego: Mmm, small \"g,\" son. At least on the days Im feeling humble as Drax. I dont know where I came from exactly. First thing I remember is flickering adrift in the cosmos utterly and entirely alone. Over millions of years I learned to control the molecules around me. I grew smarter and stronger. And I continued building from there layer by layer the very planet you walk on now. But I wanted more. I desired meaning. \"There must be some life out there in the universe besides just me,\" I thought. And so, I set myself the task of finding it. I created what I imagined biological life to be like down to the most minute detail.\\n Drax: Did you make a penis?\\n Quill: Dude!\\n Gamora: What is wrong with you?\\n Drax: If he is a planet, how could he make a baby with your mother? He would smush her!\\n Quill: I dont need to hear how my parents\\n Drax: Why? My father would tell the story of impregnating my mother every winter solstice.\\n Quill: Thats disgusting.\\n Drax: It was beautiful. You Earthers have hang-ups.\\n Ego: Yes, Drax, I got a penis.\\n Drax: Ha! Thank you!\\n Ego: Its not half bad.\\n Drax: Oh.\\n Quill: - Ugh.\\n Ego: Ive also got pain receptors, and a digestive system and all the accompanying junk. I wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human as I set out amongst the stars until I found what I sought. Life. I was not alone in the universe after all.\\n Quill: When did you meet my mother?\\n Ego: Not long after. It was with Meredith that I first experienced love. I called her my river lily. And from that love, Peter you. I have searched for you for so long. And when I heard of a man from Earth who held an Infinity Stone in his hand without dying I knew you must be the son of the woman I loved.\\n Peter Quill: If you loved her, why did you leave her?\\n [Scene changes to the Ravagers\\' ship.]\\n Tullk: This is mutiny! This is mutiny!\\n Oblo: Captain! Help me! Please! Captain!\\n Taserface: You\\'re the one what killed those men by leading them down the wrong path. Because you\\'re weak. And stupid! It\\'s time for the Ravagers to rise once again to glory with a new captain Taserface!\\n Rocket: I\\'m sorry. Your name is It\\'s Taserface?\\n Taserface: That\\'s right.\\n Rocket: Do you shoot tasers out of your face?\\n Taserface: It\\'s metaphorical!\\n Rocket: For what?\\n Taserface: For it is a name what strikes fear into the hearts of anyone what hears it.\\n Rocket: Okay whatever you say.\\n Taserface: You shut up. You\\'re next. Udonta, I have waited a long time to do What?\\n Rocket: I\\'m sorry. I am so sorry! I just keep imagining you waking up in the morning, sir looking in the mirror and then in all seriousness saying to yourself \"You know what would be a really kick-ass name? \"Taserface!\" Thats how I hear you in my head! What was your second choice? Scrotum Hat?\\n Taserface: New plan. We\\'re killing you first.\\n Rocket: Well, dying is certainly better than having to live an entire life as a moronic shitbag who thinks Taserface is a cool name.\\n Nebula: Thats enough killing for today.\\n Ravager: She\\'s the daughter of Thanos.\\n Taserface: I thought you were the biggest sadist in the galaxy.\\n Nebula: That was when Daddy was paying my bills. The Priestess wants to kill the fox herself. And he has bounties on his head in at least 12 Kree provinces. I assure you I am not as easy a mark as an old man without his magic stick or a talking woodland beast. I want 10% of the take and a couple more things.\\n Kraglin: We got a whole box of hands if that one dont work out.\\n Nebula: It is fine.\\n Kraglin: You think them Kree is gonna execute the captain?\\n Nebula: The Kree consider themselves merciful. It will be painless.\\n Kraglin: Well, here it is. Its the best ship we got. Location of Egos planet in the nav. Well wire you the 10% once wes paid. What are you gonna do with your share?\\n Nebula:  As a child, my father would have Gamora and me battle one another in training. Every time my sister prevailed my father would replace a piece of me with machinery claiming he wanted me to be her equal. But she won again and again, and again, never once refraining. So after I murder my sister I will buy a warship with every conceivable instrument of death. I will hunt my father like a dog, and I will tear him apart slowly piece by piece until he knows some semblance of the profound and unceasing pain I know every single day.\\n Kraglin: Yeah. I was talking about, like, a pretty necklace. Or a nice hat. Something to make the other girls go, \"Ooh, thats nice!\" Anyways, happy trails.\\n [Scene changes to Ego\\'s planet]\\n Quill: My mother told everyone my father was from the stars. She had brain cancer, so everyone thought she was delusional.\\n Ego: Peter\\n Quill: Listen, Id love to believe all of this, I really would. But you left the most wonderful woman ever to die alone.\\n Ego: I didnt want to leave your mother, Peter. If I dont return regularly to my planet and the light within it this form will wither and perish.\\n Quill: So why didnt you come back? Why did you send Yondu? A criminal, of all people, to come and fetch me?\\n Ego: I loved your mother, Peter! I couldnt stand to set foot on an Earth where she wasnt living! You cant imagine what thats like!\\n Quill: I know exactly what that feels like! I had to watch her die!\\n Ego: Over the millions and millions of years of my existence Ive made many mistakes, Peter. But youre not one of them. Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be. Theres so much that I need to teach you about this planet and the light within. They are a part of you, Peter.\\n Quill: What do you mean?\\n Ego: Give me your hands, son. Here. Hold them like that. Now, close your eyes and concentrate. Take your brain to the center of this planet. Yes!\\n Quill: Whoa!\\n Ego: Yes! Its okay. Just relax. Concentrate. You can do it. Bring it back. Yes! Yes, now shape it. Feel that energy. Yes. Youre home. Peter\\n Drax: How did you get to this weird, dumb planet?\\n Mantis: Ego found me in my larva state. Orphaned on my homeworld. He raised me by hand, and kept me as his own.\\n Drax: So youre a pet?\\n Mantis: I suppose.\\n Drax: People usually want cute pets. Why would Ego want such a hideous one?\\n Mantis: I am hideous?\\n Drax: You are horrifying to look at. Yes. But thats a good thing.\\n Mantis: Oh?\\n Drax: When youre ugly, and someone loves you you know they love you for who you are. Beautiful people never know who to trust.\\n Mantis: Well, then Im certainly grateful to be ugly.\\n Drax: Those pools, they remind me of a time when I took my daughter to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld. She was like you.\\n Mantis: Disgusting?\\n Drax: Innocent.\\n Mantis: Drax? Theres something I must tell you. [Before she can tell him, Gamora walks through the doors with a suspicious look on her face.]\\n Gamora: Whats going on?\\n Drax: This gross bug lady is my new friend.\\n Mantis: Im learning many things, like Im a pet and ugly.\\n Gamora: Youre not ugly. Drax!\\n Drax: What are you talking about?\\n Gamora: [to Mantis] Mantis can you show us where well be staying? Why are there no other beings on this planet?\\n Mantis: The planet is Ego. A dog would not invite a flea to live on his back.\\n Gamora: And youre not a flea?\\n Mantis: Im a flea with a purpose. I help him sleep.\\n Gamora: What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?\\n Mantis: Nothing. Your quarters are this way.\\n Taserface: We deliver you to the Kree in the morning. Neither one of you will last much longer after that.\\n Rocket: Okay, Taserface. Hey, tell the other guys we said \"Hi,\" Taserface!\\n (SIGHS)\\n Gef: What about this little plant? Can I smash it with a rock?\\n Taserface: No, Gef. Its too adorable to kill. Take it to the tailor.\\n Rocket: No offense, but your employees are a bunch of jerks.\\n Yondu: I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years when Stakar freed me. He offered me a place with the Ravagers. He said all I needed to do was adhere to the code. But I was young and greedy, and stupid. Like you stealing those batteries.\\n Rocket: That was mostly Drax.\\n Yondu: Me and Stakar and the other captains we werent so different from you and your friends. The only family I ever had. When I broke the code they exiled me. This is what I deserve.\\n Rocket: Slow down, drama queen. You might deserve this, but I dont. We gotta get outta here.\\n Yondu: Wheres Quill?\\n Rocket: He went off with his old man.\\n Yondu: Ego?\\n Rocket: Yeah. Its a day for dumbass names. (CHUCKLES) Youre smiling. And for a second, I got a warm feeling. But then it was ruined by those disgusting-ass teeth.\\n Yondu: You like a professional asshole or what?\\n Rocket: Pretty much a pro. Why didnt you deliver Quill to Ego like you promised?\\n Yondu: He was skinny. Could fit into places we couldnt. Good for thievin.\\n Rocket: Uh-huh.\\n Yondu: I got an idea on how to get outta here.

So, by not saying it you are telling the truth, and admitting that there is.\\n Gamora: No, thats not what I\\n (SIGHS)\\n Gamora: What we should be discussing right now is something about this place.

You got big green guys tearing down buildings. When I was a kid, I used to draw cowboys and Indians. Actually, it\\'s Native American, but whatever. Yeah. Tell you what, though. It ain\\'t bad, is it? No. Yeah. Kid\\'s got a future. Yeah, well... ...we\\'ll see, I guess. No, hey! You can\\'t saw through that stuff. These alien bastards are tough. You gotta use the stuff they use. - See? All right. - All right. Oh, hey! Glad you could join us. Afternoon. - Yeah. My alarm didn\\'t go off. - Yeah, your alarm. Look, just go stack that armor plating like I asked you. This is a huge deal for us. Attention, please! In accordance with Executive Order 396B... ...all post-battle cleanup operations are now under our jurisdiction. Thank you for your service. We\\'ll take it from here. Who the hell are you? Qualified personnel. Look, I have a city contract to salvage all this, okay, with the city, so- I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage operations are now under ou rjurisdiction. Please turn over any and all exotic materials that you\\'ve collected... ...or you will be prosecuted. Ma\\'am, what am-- ? Please. Come here. Hey, lady, come on. Look... ...I bought trucks for this job. I brought in a whole new crew. These guys have a family. I have a family. I\\'m all in on this. I could lose my house. I\\'m sorry, sir. There\\'s nothing I can do. Maybe next time, don\\'t overextend yourself. What\\'d you say? Yeah. He\\'s right. I overextended myself. - Hey, hey, hey. - Don\\'t do it. Put them down. If you have a grievance, you may take it up with my superiors. Your superiors. Who the hell are they? A joint venture between Stark Industries and the government... ...the Department of Damage Control, will oversee the collection... ...and storage of alien and other exotic materials. Now the assholes who made this mess are paid to clean it up. Yeah, it\\'s all rigged. Experts estimate there are over 1500 tons of exotic material... ...scattered throughout the tri-state area. Hey, chief! We have another load from yesterday. We\\'re supposed to turn this in, right? I ain\\'t hauling it. It\\'s too bad. We could have made some cool stuff from all that alien junk. I tell you what. Let\\'s keep it. The world\\'s changing. It\\'s time we change, too. There you go, Mason. Business is good. New York. Queens. - t\\'s a rough borough, but, hey, it\\'s home. - Who you talking to? No one. Just making a little video of the trip. - You know you can\\'t show it to anyone. - Yeah, I know. Then why are you narrating in that voice? - Because it\\'s fun. - Fun. So why do they call you Happy? Come on. I\\'m not carrying your bags. Let\\'s go. Hey, should I go to the bathroom before? There\\'s a bathroom on it. No pilot? That\\'s awesome. - Is that where you\\'re gonna sit? - Yeah. This is your first time on a private plane? My first time on any plane. Should it-- ? Should it be-- ? Should it be making that noise? No one has actually told me why I\\'m in Berlin or what I\\'m doing. Something about Captain America going crazy. - This is you. - Oh, we\\'re neighbors? We\\'re not roommates. Suit up. Okay, Peter, you got this. - What the hell are you wearing? - It\\'s my suit. - Where\\'s the case? - What case? What? I thought that was a closet. - This is still my room? - Go. - My room is way bigger than-- - There. I found the case. I found the case. \"A minor upgrade\"? Oh, my God. - Put it on. - What the-- ?   This is the coolest thing I\\'ve ever seen-- - Let\\'s go. - But, yeah. Well, I don\\'t understand. Is it for me? Happy. Happy, wait. This is insane. Insane. Look at this thing. Look. Look at the eyes. - This is the greatest day of my life. - Let\\'s go. Okay, there\\'s Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow. Who\\'s that new guy? - Underoos! - Oh, that\\'s me. I gotta go. I gotta go. Hey, everyone. The craziest thing just happened. I just had a fight with Captain America. I stole his shield. I threw it at him-- What the hell? He\\'s big now. I gotta go. Hang on. It was the most amazing thing! Mr. Stark was like, \"Hey, Underoos!\" I flipped in and stole Cap\\'s shield. I was like, \"What\\'s up, everybody?\" And then-- Hey, just a second! coming! L- ley- We have thin walls here. What are you doing, a little video diary? - Yeah. - It\\'s all right. - I\\'d do the same thing. - I told him not to. - He was filming. I\\'m gonna wipe the chip. - Okay. Hey. You know what? We should make an alibi video for your aunt anyway. You ready? - An alibi? Sure. Okay. - We rolling? Get in the frame. Hey, May. How you doing? What are you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope. Peter, that\\'s inappropriate. Let\\'s start over. You can edit it. Three, two, one. Hey, May. My gosh, I wanted to tell you what an incredible job your nephew did... ...this weekend at the Stark internship retreat. Everyone was impressed. Come on! It\\'s a freaking merge. I\\'m sorry. This is because you\\'re not on Queens Boulevard. See, Happy is hoping to get bumped up to asset management. He was forehead of security, before that he was a driver. That was a private conversation. I don\\'t like joking about this. It was hard to talk about that. - No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?  - Here we are. End of the line. - Can you give us a moment? - Want me to leave? Grab Peter\\'s case out of the trunk. I can keep the suit? Yes, we were just talking about it. Do me a favor, though. Happy\\'s kind of your point guy on this. Don\\'t stress him out. Don\\'t do anything stupid. I\\'ve seen his cardiogram. - All right? - Yes. Don\\'t do anything I would do, and don\\'t do anything I wouldn\\'t do. There\\'s a little gray area in there. That\\'s where you operate. - Wait, does that mean I\\'m an Avenger? - No. - This it? - Seventh floor. - I can take that. You don\\'t have to. - You\\'ll take it? - Yeah, I can take that. - Thank you. So when\\'s our next-- ? When\\'s our next \"retreat,\" you know? - What, next mission? - Yeah, the mission. The missions. - We\\'ll call you. - Do you have my numbers? No, I mean, we\\'ll call you. Like, someone will call you. All right? - From your team. - Okay. All right. It\\'s not a hug. I\\'m just grabbing the door for you. We\\'re not there yet. Bye. They\\'re gonna call me. What\\'s up, Penis Parker? Rise and shine, Midtown Science and Technology. Don\\'t forget about your homecoming tickets. Do you have a date for homecoming? Thanks, Jason, but I already have a date. - Okay. - Yeah. Damn it. You, in my office right now. Join me, and together... ...we\\'ll build my new LEGO Death Star. - What? - So lame. That\\'s awesome. How many pieces? Three thousand eight hundred and three. - That\\'s insane. - I know. You want to build it tonight? No, I can\\'t tonight. I\\'ve got the Stark-- - Stark internship. - Yeah, exactly. Always got that internship. Yeah, well, hopefully, soon it\\'ll lead to a real job with them. - That would be so sweet. - Right? He\\'d be all, \"Good job on those spreadsheets, Peter. Here\\'s a gold coin.\"  - I don\\'t know how jobs work. - That\\'s exactly how they work. I\\'ll knock out the bones of the Death Star. I\\'ll come by afterwards. For the most part, the difficult thing is the base of it. The top half we can knock out in two hours, tops. That\\'d be great. I\\'m gonna be late. Okay, so how do we calculate linear acceleration... ...between points A and B? Flash. It\\'s the product of sine of the angle and gravity divided by mass. Nope. Peter. You still with us? Yeah, yeah. Mass cancels out, so it\\'s just gravity times sine. Right. See, Flash, being the fastest isn\\'t always the best if you are wrong. You\\'re dead. Today we\\'re talking about Danish physicist Niels Bohr... ...but trust me, there\\'s nothing Bohr-ing... ...about his discoveries regarding quantum theory. Did Liz get a new top? No. We\\'ve seen that before, but never with that skirt. - Liz, hey. That looks so good. - Hi! We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy. Too late. You guys are losers. Well, then why do you sit with us? Because I don\\'t have any friends. Next question. What is the heaviest naturally-occurring element? Hydrogen\\'s the lightest. That\\'s not the question. Okay. - Yeah. - Uranium. Correct. Thank you, Abraham. - Yes. - Please open your books to page 10. Peter, it\\'s nationals. Is there no way you could take one weekend off? I can\\'t go to Washington. If Mr. Stark needs me, I have to make sure I\\'m here. You\\'ve never been in the same room as Tony Stark. Wait. What\\'s happening? - Peter\\'s not going to Washington. - No. - No, no, no. - Why not? Really? Right before nationals? He already quit marching band and robotics lab. I\\'m not obsessed with him. Just very observant. Flash, you\\'re in for Peter. I don\\'t know. I gotta check my calendar first.  I got a hot date with Black Widow coming up. That is false. What\\'d I tell you about using the bell for comedic purposes? - Hey, what\\'s up? - Hey, man. What\\'s up, Mr. Delmar? Hey, Mr. Parker. Number five, right? Yeah, and with pickles, and can you smush it down real flat? Thanks. You got it, boss. How\\'s your aunt? Yeah, she\\'s all right. She\\'s a very hot Italian woman. How\\'s your daughter? - Ten dollars. - It\\'s 5 dollars. - For that comment, 10 dollars. - Hey, come on. I\\'m joking. I\\'m joking. Here\\'s 5 dollars. What\\'s up, Murph? How you doing, buddy? So how\\'s school? It\\'s boring. Got better things to do. Stay in school, kid. Otherwise, you\\'re gonna end up like me. - This is great. - Best sandwiches in Queens. Finally. - What\\'s the matter with you? - Could you hold this? Thanks. Hey, is this anybody\\'s bike? No? - Hey, buddy, is this your bike? - I have no change. Does anyone have a pen? Do you have a pen? Everybody good? Hey! You\\'re that spider guy on YouTube, right? Call me Spider-Man. Okay, Spider-Man. Do a flip. - Yeah! - Not bad. Hey, buddy. - Shouldn\\'t steal cars, it\\'s bad. - It\\'s my car, dumb-ass! Hey! Shut that off! - Can you tell him it\\'s my car? - I was-- - I work at nights. Come on. - That\\'s not your car! - That\\'s his car. - How was I supposed to know? - He was putting that in the window! - Every day with these alarms! - Turn it off! - Don\\'t make me come down there, punk. Hey, Gary. How you doing? Marjorie, how are you? How\\'s your mother? I\\'m good, I\\'m good. You have reached the voice-mail box of: Happy Hogan. Hey, Happy. Here\\'s my report for tonight. I stopped a grand theft bicycle. Couldn\\'t find the owner, so I just left a note. I helped this lost, old Dominican lady. She was really nice  and bought me a churro. I just feel like I could be doing more. You know? Just curious when the next real mission\\'s gonna be. So, yeah, just call me back. It\\'s Peter. Parker. Why would I tell him about the churro? Hey, hey- Okay. - Can\\'t wait to see this thing. - Finally, something good. Yo, this high-tech stuff makes it too easy. - Told you it was worth it. - Okay, go, go, go. Oh, nice. We can hit, like, five more places tonight. What\\'s up, guys? You forget your PIN number? You\\'re the Avengers. What are you guys doing here? Thor. Hulk. Good to finally meet you guys. I thought you\\'d be more handsome in person. Iron Man. Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank? You\\'re a billionaire. Hey\" Oh, this feels so weird. What is that thing? I\\'m starting to think you\\'re not the Avengers. 911. What\\'s your emergency? Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers in a bank on 21st Street. Let\\'s wrap this up. It\\'s a school night. So how do jerks like you get tech like this? No. Wait, wait, wait! Mr. Delmar. Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in here? ls anybody in here? Hello? Oh, come on. I gotta-- - Here, here. - Good, yeah. Okay. Good. Yes. Yes-- No. No, put that down. That\\'s worth more than you or me. Yeah? The craziest thing just happened. These guys were robbing an ATM... - ...with high-tech weapons-- - Take a breath. I don\\'t have time... - ...for ATM robberies... - Yeah, but-- ...or the notes you leave. I have moving day to worry about. Everything\\'s gotta be out next week. - Wait. You\\'re moving? Who\\'s moving? - Yeah, don\\'t you watch the news? Tony sold Avengers Tower. We\\'re relocating to a new facility upstate... - ...where hopefully cell service is worse. - But what about me? What about you? Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me  or something big goes down? - Can I please talk to Mr. Stark? - Stay away from anything dangerous. I\\'m responsible for making sure you\\'re responsible, okay? I am responsible. I-- Oh, crap. - My backpack\\'s gone. - That doesn\\'t sound responsible. - I\\'ll call you back. - Feel free not to. What was that? It\\'s nothing. Nothing. You\\'re the Spider-Man. - From YouTube. - I\\'m not. I\\'m not. - You were on the ceiling. - No. What are you doing in my room? May let me in. We were gonna finish the Death Star. You can\\'t just bust into my room! That turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster. Let\\'s go to dinner. Thai? Ned, you want Thai? - Yes. - No. He\\'s got a thing. A thing to do after. Okay. Maybe put on some clothes. - Oh, she doesn\\'t know? - Nobody knows. Mr. Stark knows because he made my suit. That\\'s it. Tony Stark made you that? Are you an Avenger? Yeah, basically. You can\\'t tell anybody about this. You gotta keep it a secret. - Secret? Why? - You know what she\\'s like. If she finds out people try and kill me every night, she won\\'t let me do this. Come on, Ned, please. Okay, okay, okay. I\\'ll level with you. I can\\'t keep this a secret. It\\'s the greatest thing that\\'s ever happened to me. Ned, May cannot know. I cannot do that to her right now. You know? I mean, everything that\\'s happened with her, I-- Please. - Okay. - Just swear it, okay? I swear. - Thank you. - Yeah. I can\\'t believe this is happening now. - Can I try the suit on? - No. How\\'s it work? Magnets? How do you shoot the strings? - I\\'m gonna tell you at school tomorrow. - Great. Okay, well, wait, then. How do you do this and the Stark internship? This is the Stark internship. Just get out of here. What\\'s the matter? Thought you loved larb. It\\'s too larby?  Not larby enough. How many times do I have to say \"larb\" before you talk to me? You know I larb you. I\\'m just stressed. The internship, and I\\'m tired. A lot of work. The Stark internship. I have to tell you, not a fan of that Tony Stark. You\\'re distracted all the time. He\\'s got you in your head. - Delmar\\'s Sandwiches was destroyed... - What does he have you doing? - ...in an explosion... - You need to use your instincts. ...after an ATM robbery was thwarted by Queens\\' own crime stopper... What? ...the Spider-Man. As the Spider-Man attempted to foil their heist... ...a powerful blast was set off, slicing through the bodega across the street. Miraculously, no one was harmed. If you spot something like that happening, you turn and you run the other way. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. Six blocks away from us. I need a new backpack. - What? - I need a new backpack. That\\'s five. - Sticky rice pudding. - We didn\\'t order that. It\\'s on the house. Thanks. That\\'s nice of him. I think he larbs you. You got bit by a spider? Can it bite me? Well, it probably would\\'ve hurt, right? Whatever. Even if it did hurt, I\\'d let it bite me. Maybe. How much did it hurt? The spider\\'s dead, Ned. You were here? Yeah. You could\\'ve died. Do you lay eggs? What? No. - Can you spit venom? - No. Can you summon an army of spiders? No, Ned. The Sokovia Accords were put into place... How far can you shoot your webs? It\\'s unknown. Shut up. -- To begin regulating... If I was you, I would stand on a building... - ...and just shoot it as far as I could-- - Shut up, Ned. Hi. I\\'m Captain America. Whether you\\'re in the classroom or on the battlefield... - Do you know him too? - Yeah, we met. ...fitness can be the difference between success or failure.  - I stole his shield. - What? Today, my good friend, your gym teacher... ...will conduct the Captain America Fitness Challenge. Thank you, Captain. Pretty sure he\\'s a war criminal, but I have to show these videos. It\\'s required by the state. Let\\'s do it. Do Avengers have to pay taxes? What does Hulk smell like? - I bet he smells nice. - You have to shut up. Is Captain America cool, or is he like a mean, old grandpa? Ned, just...okay? - Hey, can I be your guy in the chair? - What? Yeah. You know how there\\'s a guy with a headset... ...telling the other guy where t0 go? If you\\'re in a burning building, I could tell you where to go. There\\'d be screens around me, and I could swivel around. - I could be your guy in the chair. - I don\\'t need a guy in the chair. Looking good, Parker. Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor... ...marry Iron Man and kill Hulk. Well, what about the Spider-Man? It\\'s just Spider-Man. Did you see the bank security cam on YouTube? He fought off four guys. Oh, my God, she\\'s crushing on Spider-Man. No way. - Kind of. - Oh, gross. - He\\'s probably 30. - You don\\'t know what he looks like. Like, what if he\\'s seriously burned? I wouldn\\'t care. I\\'d love him for the person he is inside. Peter knows Spider-Man. No, I don\\'t. No. I-- I mean-- They\\'re friends. Yeah, like Coach Wilson and Captain America are friends. I\\'ve met him, yeah. A couple times. But it\\'s... ...through the Stark internship. Yeah, well, I\\'m not really supposed to talk about it. Well, that\\'s awesome. Hey, you know what? Maybe you should invite him to Liz\\'s party. Right? Yeah, I\\'m having people over tonight. You\\'re more than welcome to come. - Having a party? - Yeah, it\\'s gonna be dope. You should totally invite your personal friend Spider-Man.  It\\'s okay. I know Peter\\'s way too busy for parties anyway, so... Come on. He\\'ll be there. Right, Parker? What are you doing? Helping you out. Did you not hear her? Liz has a crush on you. Dude, you\\'re an Avenger. If any one of us has a chance with a senior girl, it\\'s you. House party in the suburbs. Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous. It\\'ll be a night to remember. Ned, some hats wear men. You wear that hat. Yeah, it gives me confidence. This is a mistake. Hey, let\\'s just go home. Oh, Peter. I know. I know it\\'s really hard... ...trying to fit in with all the changes your body\\'s going through. It\\'s flowering now. He\\'s so stressed out lately. What helps with stress is a party. - We should go to the party. - Yeah, let\\'s do it. I\\'m gonna go. Peter. - Have fun, okay? Okay. - I will. Bye, May. Dude, you have the suit, right? - Yeah. - This is gonna change our lives. - Annie, over here! - Hey. L- ley- DJ Flash. Okay. We\\'re gonna have Spider-Man swing in... ...say you guys are tight, and I get a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs. Can\\'t believe you\\'re at this lame party. But you\\'re here too. Am w. Oh, my gosh. Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned. - Hi, Liz. - Hi, Liz. I\\'m so happy you guys came. There\\'s pizza and drinks. Help yourself. - What a great party. - Thanks. Oh, I-- My parents will kill me if anything\\'s broken. I gotta-- - Yeah. - Have fun. - Bye. - Bye. Dude, what are you doing? She\\'s here. Spider it up. No, no, no. I can\\'t-- I cannot do this. Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay? Look, I\\'m just gonna be myself. Peter, no one wants that. Dude. Penis Parker, what\\'s up? So where\\'s your pal Spider-Man? Let me guess: In Canada with your imaginary girlfriend? That\\'s not Spider-Man.  That\\'s just Ned in a red shirt. \"Hey, what\\'s up? I\\'m Spider-Man. Just thought I\\'d swing by and say hello to my buddy Peter. Oh, what\\'s up, Ned? Hey, where\\'s Peter, anyways? He must be around...\" God, this is stupid. What am I doing? What the hell? This sucks. Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia. Here. You try. I wanted something low-key. Why are you trying to upsell me, man? Okay, okay. I got what you need, all right? I got tons of great stuff here. One sec. Okay, I got black hole grenades, Chitauri railguns... You letting off shots in public now? Hurry up. Look, times are changing. We\\'re the only ones selling these high-tech weapons. This must be where the ATM robbers got their stuff. I need something to stick up somebody. I\\'m not trying to shoot them back in time. I got antigrav climbers. Yo, climbers? Okay, what the hell is that? - Did you set us up? - Hey, hey, man. Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot at somebody, shoot at me. All right. What was that? - We gotta call him. - No, no, no. Did you just do it again? - Shut up. - I\\'m calling him. Toomes\\'s phone. Boss. Oh, my butt! Great. Guess I\\'m gonna have to take a shortcut. Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun. Hey, hey, buddy. Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch. Now, this is more like it. Smells really good. Great movie! Oh, hey, guys. NO! No! Hey, it\\'s Peter. Leave a message. Peter, where are you? The hat\\'s not working. This is not cool. Almost got you. Thought you got away from me, didn\\'t you? I got you right where I want you. Surprise! What the hell? Oh, hey. And then he just, like, swooped down like a monster... ...and picked me up, and took me up like a thousand feet and just dropped me. How\\'d you find me?  Did you put a tracker in my suit? I put everything in your suit. Including this heater. That\\'s better. Thanks. What were you thinking? The guy with wings is the source of the weapons. I gotta take him down. Take him down now, huh? Crockett, there are people who handle this son of thing. - The Avengers? - No. This is a little below their pay grade. Mr. Stark, you didn\\'t have to come out here. I had that. I was fine. Oh, I\\'m not here. Thank God this place has Wi-Fi... ...or you would be toast right now. Thank Ganesh while you\\'re at it. Cheers. Look, forget the flying vulture guy, please. - Why? - Why? Because I said so! Sorry, I\\'m talking to a teenager. Stay close to the ground. Build up your game helping little people, like that lady that bought you the churro. Can\\'t you just be a friendly... ...neighborhood Spider-Man? But I\\'m ready for more than that now. No, you\\'re not. That\\'s not what you thought when I took on Captain America. Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted to lay you out, he would\\'ve. Listen to me. If you come across these weapons again, call Happy. Are you driving? You know, it\\'s never too early to start thinking about college. I got some pull at MIT. End call. No, I don\\'t need to go to-- Mr. Stark is no longer connected. That\\'s awesome. \"Stay close to the ground\"? What is he talking about? Hey, what\\'s up? I\\'m on my way back. Actually, I was calling to say maybe you shouldn\\'t come. Listen. When I say \"penis,\" you say \"Parker.\" - Penis! - Parker! - Penis! - Parker! Sorry, Peter. I guess we\\'re still losers. - I\\'ll see you tomorrow. - I\\'ll see you tomorrow in school. Idiots. Idiots. Idiots! Boss? Your wife keeps texting you. Something about a brake light. What\\'d I tell you about looking at my phone? Sorry. You left it out.  You know I\\'m a curious person by nature. I finished designing that high-altitude vacuum seal. In case you want to, you know, go for the big one? You\\'re still on that? I told you, no. The answer\\'s no. Forget it. I mean, that was badass. How many times have I told you not to fire them out in the open? - You said, move the merchandise. - Under the radar. Under the radar! That\\'s how we survive. If you bring Damage Control or the Avengers down here, we\\'re through. You\\'re out there wearing that goofy thing, lighting up cars... ...calling yourself the Shocker. \"I\\'m the Shocker. I shock people.\" What is this, pro wrestling? Whatever, old man. Come on. Look. Look. I know you don\\'t give a crap about anything. But I do. I built this whole place because I got people I have to look after. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what? I can\\'t afford your bullshit. - Get out of here. - What? - You\\'re done. You\\'re off the crew. - Yeah, all right. All right. Wonder if you can afford me out there, though, right? With everything I know. - Excuse me? - I\\'m just saying... ...maybe your wife would like to know where you really get your money from. - You know what? - What? You\\'re right. - That work? - I don\\'t know. I can\\'t afford that. Wait. Damn. - I thought this was the antigravity gun. - What? No, that\\'s that one. Here. Now you\\'re the Shocker. Go out there and find that weapon he lost. All right. Hey, thanks for bailing on me. Yeah, well, something came up. What is that? I don\\'t know. Some guy tried to vaporize me with it. - Seriously? - Yeah. Awesome. I mean, not awesome. Totally uncool of that guy. So scary. Well, look, I think it\\'s... ...a power source. Yeah, but it\\'s connected to all these microprocessors.  That\\'s an inductive charging plate. That\\'s what I use to charge my toothbrush. Whoever\\'s making these weapons is combining alien tech with ours. That is literally the coolest sentence anyone has ever said. I just want to thank you for letting me be part of your journey... ...into this amazing-- Keep your fingers clear of the blades. I gotta figure out what this is and who makes it. We\\'ll go to the lab after class and run tests. Let\\'s do it. First, we put the glowy thing in the mass spectrometer. We gotta come up with a better name than \"glowy thingy.\" You\\'re right. Crap. Come on, come on, come on. High schools creep me out. They got this funny smell, you know? Hey, that\\'s one of the guys that tried to kill me. What? - Yeah. - We gotta get out of here. No, no, no. I gotta follow them. They can lead me to the guy that dropped me in the lake. - Someone dropped you in a lake? - Yeah, it was not good. - Peter-- - No. Stay there, Ned. Peter. What are you doing? Nothing. Yeah. You good? Chess. Man, can you imagine what the boss would say if he knew where we were? It\\'s saying there was an energy pulse here. There\\'s no sign of the weapon. - And even if it was here, now it\\'s gone. - So are we. This is so awesome. I know, right? They\\'re in Brooklyn. Staten Island. Leaving Jersey. They stopped. Maryland? - What\\'s there? - I don\\'t know. Evil lair? - They have a lair? - A gang with alien guns... ...run by a guy with wings? Yeah. Badass. But how are you gonna get there if it\\'s, like, 300 miles away? It\\'s not too far from D.C. - Hey, it\\'s Peter. - Guys. - Peter? - Hey, buddy. I was hoping I could rejoin the team. No, no way. You can\\'t quit on us... ...stroll up and be welcomed back by everyone. Hey, welcome back!  Flash, you\\'re back to first alternate. - What? - He\\'s taking your place. Excuse me, can we go already? I was hoping to get in some protesting in front of an embassy before dinner. Protesting is patriotic. Let\\'s get on the bus. Focus up. Our next topic is the moons of Saturn. The second law of thermodynamics. - Frank Sinatra. - Fort Sumter. - Flash is wrong. - Okay, let\\'s focus. Next one. Liz, don\\'t overwork them. Strontium, barium, vibranium. Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back. Glad to be back. - What is the current standard unit of-- ? - Can I take this real quick? Yeah, fine. - Hello? - Got a blip on my screen here. You left New York? - Okay, focus up, everyone. - Tracker. Yeah, it\\'s just a school trip. It\\'s nothing. Happy, I gotta say, tracking me without permission... ...is a complete violation of privacy. - That\\'s different. - What\\'s different? Nothing. Look, it\\'s just the Academic Decathlon. - It\\'s no big deal. - Hey, hey. I\\'ll decide if it\\'s no big deal. Sounds like no big deal, but remember, I\\'m watching you. - Everyone stick together. - Yeah. You kidding me? This place is huge. - I\\'ve seen bigger. - There\\'s a bird in here. - Hey, you brought your laptop, right? - Why? Peter... ...why are we removing the tracker from your suit? I gotta follow these guys to their boss before they move again... ...and I don\\'t really want Mr. Stark to know about it. So you\\'re lying to Iron Man now? No, I\\'m not lying. He just doesn\\'t really get what I can do yet. Gotcha. All right, Happy, enjoy tracking this lamp. There\\'s a ton of other subsystems in here... ...but they\\'re all disabled by the Training Wheels Protocol. What? \"Training Wheels Protocol\"? Turn it off. I don\\'t think that\\'s a good idea. They\\'re blocked for a reason.  Come on, man, I don\\'t need training wheels. I\\'m sick of him treating me like a kid all the time. - t\\'s not cool. - But you are a kid. A kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands. Peter, I just don\\'t think this is a great idea. I mean, what if this is illegal? Look, please. This is my chance to prove myself. I can handle it. Ned, come on. - I don\\'t think this is a good idea. - The guy in the chair. - Don\\'t do that. - Come on. The glowy thing, it\\'s evidence. Keep it safe. - All right? - Okay. Okay. - They\\'re moving. - Be careful. - Hey, Liz. - Perfect timing. We\\'re gonna go swimming. - Come on, come on, come on. - What? - Hey, Peter. - Hi. L- ley- I was-- I was gonna go study in the business center. You don\\'t need to. You\\'re the smartest guy I\\'ve ever met. And besides... ...a rebellious group activity the day before competition is good for morale. Well, I read that in a TED Talk, so-- I-- I heard it in a TED Talk. And I read a coaching book. You really-- This is really important to you. Yeah. It\\'s our future. I\\'m not gonna screw it up. Besides, we raided the minibar and these candy bars were, like, $11. - So get your trunks on and come on. - Come on. - Come on. - I\\'m coming, I\\'m coming. Let\\'s go. - Good evening, Peter. - Hello? Hello? Congratulations on completing the Training Wheels Protocol... ...and gaining access to your suit\\'s full capabilities. Thank you. Where would you like to take me tonight? I put a tracker on someone. He\\'s a bad guy. Tracker located. Plotting course to intercept target. As long as I make it back in time for decathlon, it\\'s fine. One hundred meters from destination and closing. Jump now. Detecting three individuals. Why is their secret lair in a gas station? That\\'s so lame.  Hey, suit lady, what are they doing? Do you want to hear what they\\'re saying? I can hear what they\\'re saying? Yeah. Activating Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode. I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup. The rest is my design. Whoa, that\\'s so cool. Can\\'t believe they\\'re still cleaning up that Triskelion mess. I love it. They keep making messes... - ...we keep getting rich. - Target inbound. They\\'re in the middle of a heist. I could catch them red-handed. This is awesome. Okay, I\\'ll get closer to see what\\'s happening. Would you like me to engage Enhanced Combat Mode? \"Enhanced Combat Mode\"? Yeah. Activating instant Kill. No, no, no. I don\\'t want to kill anybody. Deactivating Instant Kill. Did you hear that? What the hell just happened? What was that? You jumped off the sign and landed on your face. What\\'s wrong with my web-shooters? Rapid-fire is the default for Enhanced Combat Mode. - Why would I need rapid-fire? - Would you like to see more options? You have 576 possible web-shooter combinations. Mr. Stark really overdid it. You two wait right here. Wait. You\\'re gonna want to turn on the dampers. - That thing will shatter your arm. - All right, where\\'s the dampers? - That one. - Great choice. Would you like me to set this as your new default? No, no, no. - Push that in. No, the other-- - Here? This one here? - What was that? - Taser webs. Taser webs? I don\\'t want Taser webs. You seem to be unfamiliar with your web-shooter settings. Would you like to run a refresher course? - No. Just-- You choose. - Sure thing. Six-alpha-niner, are you running on time? Copy, central. Six-alpha-niner on schedule. - I got a visual. - Green light, green light. Oh, that\\'s him. Okay. I got eyes on the convoy.  Pulling in behind the caboose. Deploy anchors. Dropping down. No outgoing distress signals. You\\'re clear. Hey. Looks like they got some good stuff here. Cool. It\\'s like some kind of matter phase shifter. All right, coming up. Hey, Big Bird. This doesn\\'t belong to you. Oh, God. - Suit lady, what was that?! - You told me to choose. What? No, just set everything back to normal. Activating all systems. My head. You appear to have a mild concussion. Hey, so where am I right now? I\\'m not sure. The container walls are hindering my sensors. Wait a minute. They must have hijacked the truck and taken me to their evil lair. Okay, suit lady, we\\'re gonna have to fight our way out of this one. Three, two, one. What is this place? Suit lady, where am I? You\\'re in the most secure facility on the eastern seaboard. The Damage Control deep storage vault. No. Seriously? The door will most likely remain closed until morning. Morning? Hey, suit lady. I kind of feel bad calling you \"suit lady,\" you know? I think I should probably give you a name. Like Liz. No, no, no. God, that\\'s-- That\\'s weird. What about Karen? You can call me Karen if you would like. Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do? What? Maybe we should run that refresher course. - Ricochet web. - Ricochet web. - Cool. - Splitter web. - Web grenade. - Web grenade! Should I tell Liz that I\\'m Spider-Man? Who is Liz? Who\\'s Liz? She\\'s-- She\\'s the best. She\\'s awesome. She\\'s just a girl who goes to my school. And-- Yeah, I just-- I really want to tell her, but it\\'s kind of weird, you know? \"Hey, I\\'m Spider-Man.\" What\\'s weird about that? What if she\\'s expecting someone like Tony Stark? Imagine how disappointed she\\'d be when she sees me. Well, if I were her, I wouldn\\'t be disappointed at all.  Thanks, Karen. It\\'s really nice to have somebody to talk to. Hey, how long we been here anyways? - Thirty-seven minutes- - What?! Thirty-seven minutes? That\\'s insane. I cannot take this anymore. I got t0-- I gotta get out of here. There\\'s got t0 be something in here I can use. Okay, let\\'s see. Nope. That\\'s awesome. Hey, it\\'s like the glowy thing. That glowy thing is an explosive Chitauri energy core. You mean, we\\'ve been carrying around a bomb? t would require radiation to transform it into an explosive state. No, no, no. Hey! Please! Please, somebody let me out! Hey! Karen, you have to help me override that time lock. Okay, Karen, lower the voltage and run it. Trial unsuccessful. Okay, we\\'re just gonna have to try every sequence. Ned, Peter, we\\'re gonna be late. Come on, let\\'s go. Okay. Hold on, hold on. Initiating trial 247. It worked. It works. Please be sure all cell phones are turned off. Thank you. Karen, get me to decathlon as fast as possible. Sure thing. Just tell me where it is. Across the street from the Washington Monument. - It\\'s Ned. Leave a message. - Call me back. The glowy thing\\'s a bomb! There\\'s a vehicle approaching on your right. We have now entered sudden death. The next correct answer wins the championship. Midtown Tech? Zero. That is correct. Midtown takes the championship. - We won. - You guys, I am so proud of you. - Told you we didn\\'t need Peter. - Flash, you didn\\'t answer a question. - Taking it all in, Michelle? - Oh, yeah, I just-- I don\\'t want to celebrate something that was built by slaves. I\\'m sure the Washington Monument wasn\\'t built by-- Okay. - Enjoy your book. - Thanks. - Oh, Ned, you\\'re alive. - Peter, are you okay? Where\\'s the glowy thing?  The glowy thing? - t\\'s safe. It\\'s in my backpack. - Ned, listen, the glowy thing is dangerous. You missed the decathlon. I covered for you. - Listen. - We\\'re at the Washington Monument. - Peter, is that you? - Hey, Liz. - Is that Liz? - Put Ned back on the phone. - You should tell her how you feel. - You flake. You are lucky we won. I want to be mad, but I\\'m more worried. Like, what is going on with you? I have to talk to Ned. It\\'s important. - All items on the belt, please. - There\\'s something in Ned\\'s backpack. It\\'s dangerous. Don\\'t let it go through x-ray. Liz? Liz! Damn it. Can I be the one to tell Peter he\\'s expelled? The Washington Monument is 555 feet, five and one-eighth inches tall. Notice how the marble and granite are cut around the stone. No, no, no. Karen, what\\'s going on up there? The Chitauri core has detonated... ...and caused severe structural damage to the elevator. - Oh, no. - My friends are up there. What? Don\\'t worry, ma\\'am, everything\\'s gonna be okay. Excuse me, excuse me. Oh, my God, that\\'s tall. Oh, my God. Look at the ceiling. Just stay calm, everyone. Oh, we are all going to die here. Estimating 10 minutes before catastrophic failure. We\\'re freaking screwed. Okay, I know that was scary, but our safety systems are working. The safety systems are completely failing. We\\'re very safe in here. The occupants are in imminent mortal danger. Going as fast as I can! - Let\\'s go. - Give me your hand. You now have 125 seconds until catastrophic failure. What?! Why? Unexpected motion has caused the deterioration to escalate. - How do I get in there? - Activating reconnaissance drone. Has that been there this whole time? That\\'s awesome. Locating optimal entry point. Proceed to southwest window.  Karen, I\\'m on my way. - There\\'s a lot of glass here. - You got this. Keep coming, keep coming. Okay. Oh, my God. Okay. What\\'s wrong? You\\'ve reached the southwest window. - Why are you hesitating? - It\\'s fine. I\\'ve just never been this high before. You have also not reinstalled your parachute... ...so a fall from this height would most likely be lethal. Perfect. Oh, my God. Why is it not breaking? It\\'s four-inch ballistic glass. You\\'ll have to create more momentum. This is D.C. Metro Police. Identify yourself. My friends are in there! Stop! Return to the ground immediately. - Okay, who\\'s next? - Me, it\\'s my turn. Flash, seriously? What are you doing? - Come on. - Don\\'t worry about the trophy. Stand down! Return to the ground immediately. Return to the ground or we will open fire! Go up, 90 UP- I got this. Take my trophy. This is your last chance. I\\'m gonna die. Break! I did it. Hey, how you doing? Don\\'t worry. I got you. - Yes! Yes. - Hey, hey, hey. - Big guy, quit moving around. - I\\'m sorry, sir. Let\\'s go, let\\'s go! Okay, Okay- - Mr. Harrington, go. - Ned, come on. - This is your stop. - Come on, Liz. Go, go, go. Everybody out. Move it, people. Move it, move it. - Are you sure it\\'s safe? - Liz. Liz! You\\'re okay. You\\'re okay. Okay. - Oh, my God. - Good, good. Come on up. Come on, you guys, stay back. - Come on in. - You guys good? So is everyone okay? This is your chance, Peter. Kiss her. Thank you. Are you really friends with Peter Parker? I can finish the next order, but without any new materials from that truck... Yeah, damn it. We still have enough to do the Gargan deal though, right? Yeah, but then that\\'s it. Maybe it is time that I built the high-altitude seal. - Would you shut up about that?  - It\\'s only one job. No. Eight years, not a word from the feds, nothing from those... ...Halloween-costume-wearing bozos up there in Stark Tower. And then all of a sudden, this little bastard in red tights shows up. And he thinks he can tear down everything I\\'ve built. Really? I\\'m gonna kill him. - I\\'m gonna find him-- - Found him. The Spider-Man swooped in... ...heroically saving an Academic Decathlon team from Queens. The identity of the masked hero is still unknown. - Mom. - Oh, kids. All right. Peter. Come here, come here, come here. This past weekend, Midtown\\'s Academic Decathlon team... ...defeated the country\\'s best to win the national championship. Later that day, they also defeated death. Explosion. Salty scream. Flash scream. Everybody screaming. There were purple lasers and smoke. It was tight, like a Bon Jovi concert. As you know, we made it out alive, and that\\'s the important thing. I couldn\\'t bear to lose a student on a school trip. Not again. Thankfully, no one was seriously injured thanks to the Spider-Man. - Thank you, Spider-Man. - Thank you, Spider-Man. Up next: the Spider-Man mania is sweeping the school. How can you show your spider spirit? Dude, dude, dude. What is it like being famous when nobody knows it\\'s you? - Crazy, dude. - It\\'s crazy. - Should we tell everyone? - No. - Should I tell everyone? - No, dude. That\\'s not a good idea. - Okay, come on, we\\'ll be late to class. - I\\'m not going to class. You\\'re already in trouble for ditching the decathlon. Dude, listen, I figured it out. The wingsuit guy is stealing from Damage Control. What he takes from Damage Control, that\\'s how he builds the weapons. - So all I gotta do is catch him. - But we have a Spanish quiz. Ned, I\\'m probably never gonna  come back here. Mr. Stark is moving the Avengers upstate... - ...so when I bring this guy in-- - Dude. You want to be a high school dropout? I am so far beyond high school right now. Parker, my office. So... ...you got detention. You screwed up. You know what you did was wrong. The question is, how are you gonna make things right? Maybe you were trying to be cool. But take it from a guy who\\'s been frozen for 65 years... ...the only way to really be cool is to follow the rules. We all know what\\'s right. We all know what\\'s wrong. Next time those turkeys try to convince you of something... - ...you know is wrong... - Where you going? Get back here. ...just think to yourself, what would Captain America do? Why are you here? You don\\'t have detention. Oh, I know. I just like coming here to sketch people in crisis. It\\'s you. So your body\\'s changing. Believe me, I know how that feels. May? Hey, Karen. What\\'s up? Hey, Peter. How was your Spanish quiz? I was wondering if you could help me. I\\'m trying to figure out who the guys under the bridge were that night... ...but I can only remember part of a license plate. I can run facial recognition on the footage of that encounter. - Footage? - Yes, Peter. I record everything you see. - Everything? - Everything. - All the time? - It\\'s called the Baby-Monitor Protocol. Yeah, of course it is. - Yeah, just roll it back to last Friday. - With pleasure. Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party. Hey, what\\'s up, Liz? Peter\\'s told me a lot about you. No, no, no. This is just me messing around. Go later in the day, later in the day. It is I, Thor, son of Odin. No, no, no. That\\'s definitely-- That\\'s definitely not what we wanted to watch. - Your impressions are very funny.  - Fast-forward to the arms deal. Okay. - The two on the right, who are they? - Searching law enforcement databases. No records found for two of the individuals. Nothing\\'? - One individual identified. Aaron Davis, age 33. He has a criminal record and an address here in Queens. Let\\'s pay him a visit. Would you like me to activate the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol? Yeah. - Remember me? - Hey-- I need information. You\\'ll give it to me now. - All right, chill. - Come on! - What happened to your voice? - What do you mean? I heard you by the bridge. I know what a girl sound like. I\\'m not a girl. I\\'m a boy. I mean, I\\'m a-- I\\'m a man. I don\\'t care what you are, a boy, a girl-- I\\'m not a girl. I\\'m a man. Come on, man. Look, who is selling these weapons? I need to know. Give me names or else. - You ain\\'t ever done this before, huh? - Deactivate Interrogation Mode. Look, man. These guys are selling weapons that are crazy dangerous. They can\\'t be out on the streets. If one of them can cut Delmar\\'s Bodega in half-- - You know Delmar\\'s? - Yeah, best sandwich in Queens. - Sub Haven\\'s pretty good. - It\\'s too much bread. - I like bread. - Come on, man, please. Stupid Interrogation Mode. Karen, don\\'t ever do that again. The other night, you told that dude, \"if you shoot somebody, shoot me.\" That\\'s pretty ballsy. I don\\'t want those weapons in this neighborhood. I got a nephew who live here. Who are these guys? What can you tell me about the guy with the wings? Other than he\\'s a psychopath dressed like a demon, nothing. I don\\'t know who he is or where he is. - I do know where he\\'s gonna be. - Really? Yeah, this crazy dude I used to work with... ...he\\'s supposed to be doing a deal with him. Yes! Yes. - Thank--  - Hey. Hey. Hey. I didn\\'t tell you where. You don\\'t have a location. Right, of course. Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just-- Yeah. - Where is it? - Can I give you some advice? You got to get better at this part of the job. I don\\'t understand. I\\'m intimidating. - Staten Island Ferry, 11. - Oh, that\\'s soon. That\\'s gonna dissolve in two hours. No, no, no. Come fix this. - Two hours. You deserve that. - I got ice cream in here. You deserve that. You\\'re a criminal. Bye, Mr. Criminal. Nice. Okay, Karen, activate Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode. Sure thing. He\\'s up front, main deck. I hate this guy. It\\'s the guy from the bridge, right? Who\\'s that other guy? Just keep me posted. There\\'s no record of him in my criminal database. Incoming call from May Parker. Should I reroute to your heads-up display? I can\\'t talk right now. I\\'ll call her back. Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy. We can\\'t let anybody get away this time. - Who\\'s the guy on the left? - Mac Gargan. Extensive criminal record, including homicide. Would you like me to activate Instant Kill? No, Karen, stop it with the Instant Kill already. White pickup truck. Dronie, scan the ship for a white pickup truck. Oh, this is too perfect. I got the weapons, buyers and sellers in one place. - Incoming call from Tony Stark. - No, no, no. Don\\'t answer. - Mr. Parker. Got a sec? - I\\'m actually at school. - No, you\\'re not. - Nice work in D. C. - Okay. My dad never really gave me a lot of support... ...and I\\'m trying to break the cycle of shame. I\\'m in the middle of something. Don\\'t cut me off when I\\'m complimenting you. Anyway, great things are about to- What is that? I\\'m at band practice. That\\'s odd. Happy told me you quit band six weeks ago. What\\'s up? - I gotta go. End call.  - Hey. I\\'ll take those! Hey, guys. The illegal weapons-deal ferry was at 10:30. You missed it. Spider guy\\'s here. Not so fast. Are you guys okay? My bad. That was a little hard. I got to say, the other guy was way better with that thing. I\\'m honestly-- I\\'m-- I\\'m shocked. - Freeze! FBI. - Don\\'t move. - Get on the ground. - FBI. What do you mean, FBI? - The Federal Bureau of Investigation. - I know, but what are they doing here? Get out of the way. Get out of the way! No. Look out, look out, look out. Move, move, move! - Move. - Get to the top deck. We\\'re getting out of here. Activate Taser web! You\\'re messing with things you don\\'t understand. Oh, my God. What do I do? Karen... ...give me an x-ray of the boat and target all the strongest points. Web grenade. Web grenade. Splitter web, go. Great job, Peter. You are 98 percent successful. - Ninety-eight? - Yeah, Spider-Man! No, no, no. What the hell? What the hell? Hi, Spider-Man. Band practice, was it? Yeah, Iron Man! Mr. Stark. Hey, Mr. Stark, could I do anything? What do you want me to do? I think you\\'ve done enough. So that\\'s it. You\\'re just gonna run? Feds were waiting for us. Now we\\'re on Iron Man\\'s radar? Yeah, I\\'m running. You should too. You know I can\\'t do that. So now what? Mason, can you get that high-altitude seal thing up and running in time? Seriously? Yes. You will not regret this. You in? Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch... .../ tell you to stay away from this. Instead, you hacked a multimillion-dollar suit... ...so you could sneak around behind my back... ...doing the one thing I told you not to do. ls everyone okay? No thanks to you. No thanks to me? Those weapons were out there, and I tried to tell you about it... ...but you didn\\'t listen.  None of this would\\'ve happened if you had just listened to me. If you even cared, you\\'d actually be here. I did listen, kid. Who do you think called the FBI, huh? Do you know I was the only one who believed in you? Everyone else said I was crazy to recruit a 14-year-old kid. - I\\'m 15. - No, this is where you zip it, all right? The adult is talking. What if somebody had died tonight? Different story, right? Because that\\'s on you. And if you died... ...I feel like that\\'s on me. - I don\\'t need that on my conscience. - Yes, sir. - I\\'m sorry. I understand. - Sorry doesn\\'t cut it. I just wanted to be like you. And I wanted you to be better. It\\'s not working out. I\\'m gonna need the suit back. - For how long? - Forever. - Yeah, that\\'s how it works. - No, no. Please. - Let\\'s have it. - Please, this is all I have. I\\'m nothing without this suit. If you\\'re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn\\'t have it. Okay? God, I sound like my dad. I don\\'t have any other clothes. Okay, we\\'ll sort that out. L- ley- I\\'ve been calling you all day. You didn\\'t answer your phone. You can\\'t do that. Then this ferry thing happens. I\\'ve called five police stations. Five. I called five of your friends. I called Ned\\'s mother. I\\'m fine. May, I\\'m okay. Honestly, just relax. I\\'m fine. Cut the bullshit. I know you left detention. I know you left the hotel room in Washington. I know you sneak out of this house every night. That\\'s not fine. Peter, you have to tell me what\\'s going on. Just lay it out. It\\'s just me and you. I lost the Stark internship. - What? - Yeah. What happened? I just thought that I could work really hard and he could-- He would-- You know. But I screwed it up. It\\'s okay, it\\'s okay. It\\'s okay. I\\'m sorry I made you worry.  I\\'m not trying to ruin your life. Yeah, I know. Just-- - I used to sneak out too. - Yeah. And take a shower. You smell. You smell like garbage. I know. Peter, you\\'re a good kid and you\\'re a smart kid... ...so just try to keep your head straight, okay? Okay. All right, get out of here. Are you expelled? Do you have to go to that high school where the principal has a crossbow? Pretty sure that\\'s an urban myth, and, no, I\\'m not expelled. You\\'re so lucky. L- ley- - Hey. - I thought you had calculus fifth period. Yeah, I was just doing some homecoming stuff. Hey, look, I-- I just wanted to apologize about the whole decathlon thing. It\\'s fine. Last week, decathlon was the most important thing, but then I almost died. No, I\\'m-- I just mean that... ...it was not cool, especially... ...because... ...I like you. I know. You do? You\\'re terrible at keeping secrets. Yeah, you\\'d be surprised. I got to get to class, but-- I\\'d say we should hang out, but I\\'m gonna be in detention... ...forever, but-- I guess you already have a date to homecoming. Actually, I was so busy planning it, I never really got around to that part, so-- Do you want to... ...go with me? Yeah. Sure. Really? I mean, great. Cool. Cool. I\\'m actually going that way. May, I need your help. Through or around? Right? It\\'s game day. So, what\\'s the plan? Open the door for her. Tell her she looks nice, but not too much because that\\'s creepy. - Don\\'t be creepy. - No. When I dance with her, I\\'m putting my hands on her hips. I got this. - Love you. - Bye. You must be Peter. Yeah. I\\'m Liz\\'s dad. Put her there. Hell of a grip. Come on in here. Come on. Hi, Peter. You look very handsome. Thank you. You got his name right? - Freddie?  - Peter. Peter. Peter. I\\'m gonna go get Liz. Okay. You all right, Pete? Yeah. Because you look pale. You want something to drink? A bourbon or a Scotch, or something like that? I\\'m not old enough to drink. That\\'s the right answer. - Do you look beautiful. - Please don\\'t embarrass me, Dad. Doesn\\'t she, Pete? Yeah, you look really good. Once again, that\\'s the right answer. Is that a corsage? Thanks. Well, hey, I\\'m your chauffeur, so let\\'s get this show on the road. No, no, no, we have to take some pictures, babe. All right. - Oh, right here. Perfect. - Mom. Okay. Come on, you guys. Peter, closer. Smile. There you go. - Sir, you don\\'t have to drive us. - No, no, it\\'s not a big deal. I\\'m going out of town. It\\'s right on my way. - He\\'s always going. Have fun. - Last time. - Thank you. - Promise. He\\'s cute. - See you in a couple of days. All right. - Bye, baby. Come on, Pedro. - Bye, Peter. Have fun. - Yeah, I will. - What are you gonna do, Pete? - What? When you graduate, what do you think you\\'ll do? - Oh, I don\\'t know. - Don\\'t grill him, Dad. Just saying, you know. All you guys who go to that school... ...you pretty much have your life planned out, right? Yeah, no, I\\'m just a sophomore. Peter has an internship with Tony Stark. I think he doesn\\'t have to worry. Really? Stark? So cool. What do you do? Yeah, actually, I don\\'t intern for him anymore. - Seriously? - Yeah, it got... ...boring. It was boring? You got to hang outwith Spider-Man. Really? Spider-Man? What\\'s he like? Yeah, he\\'s nice. Nice man. Solid dude. Look. So cute. I\\'ve seen you around, right? I mean... ...somewhere. We\\'ve-- Have we ever-- ? Because even the voice-- He does Academic Decathlon with me. And he was at my party. It was a great party, really great, yeah.  - Beautiful house, a lot of windows. - You were there for, like, two seconds. That was-- I was there longer than two seconds. - You disappeared. - No. No, I did not disappear. Yes, you did. You disappeared like you always do, like you did in D.C. too. That\\'s terrible what happened down there in D.C. though. Were you scared? I\\'ll bet you were glad when your old pal Spider-Man... ...showed up in the elevator though, huh? Yeah, well, I actually didn\\'t go up. I saw it all from the ground. Yeah. Very lucky that he was there that day. Good old Spider-Man. Dad, the light. Here we are. End of the line. Thanks, Dad. You head in there, gumdrop. I\\'m gonna give Peter the \"dad\" talk. Don\\'t let him intimidate you. Love you. - Love you, gumdrop. - Have a safe flight. Hi. You guys look so pretty. Does she know? Know what? So she doesn\\'t. Good. Close t0 the vest. I admire that. I\\'ve got a few secrets of my own. Of all the reasons I didn\\'t want my daughter to date... Peter... ...nothing is more important than family. You saved my daughter\\'s life. I could never forget something like that. So I\\'m gonna give you one chance. Are you ready? You walk through those doors, you forget any of this happened... ...and don\\'t you ever, ever... ...interfere with my business again. Because if you do... ...I\\'ll kill you... ...and everybody you love. I\\'ll kill you dead. That\\'s what I\\'ll do to protect my family. Do you understand? L- ley- I just saved your life. Now what do you say? Thank you. You\\'re welcome. Now you go on in there and you show my daughter a good time, okay? Just not too good. L- ley- What did he say to you? Gotta go. I\\'m sorry. You don\\'t deserve this. He gave you a choice. - You chose wrong.  - What the hell? What\\'s with the crappy costume? My web-shooters. I wasn\\'t sure about this thing at first, but damn. Gross. - Why did he send you here? - Guess you\\'ll never know. Nice shot! Yes! Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz\\'s dad. - What? - I gotta tell Mr. Stark. Call Happy Hogan. He\\'s Mr. Stark\\'s head of security. Get a computer and track my phone. - Will you be okay? - Hurry, we gotta catch him... ...before he leaves town. I\\'m sorry about dinner... ...but I know when branzino\\'s fresh, and that was not fresh, okay? So-- Flash, I need your car and phone. Sir, technically, this is my dad\\'s car, sir. So I can\\'t-- Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, can you hear me? - Go for Ned. - Ned, I need you... - ...to track my phone. - Yeah, but where is it? Genius move. Okay, he just passed the GameStop on Jackson Avenue. Hey, where are the headlights on this thing? I\\'m in Flash\\'s car. - I\\'ll pull the specs. - Okay, you\\'re on speakerphone. - You stole Flash\\'s car. Awesome. - Yeah, it\\'s awesome. it\\'s-- Get out of the way, get out of the way! Move! Are you okay\\'? - I\\'ve never driven before... ...only with May in parking lots. This is a huge step up. Hey, have you gotten through to Happy yet? Yeah. I\\'m working on it. I just gotta backdoor the phone system. Guy in the chair. Takeoff in nine minutes. Hello? Hello? Who Is this? - Mr. Happy, it\\'s Ned. - Who? I\\'m an associate of Peter Parker. Got something very important to tell you-- You gotta be shitting me. Damn. Hey, Ned, how we coming on with those headlights? Round knob to the left of the steering wheel, turn clockwise. Left, okay. Okay, perfect. So where\\'s my phone now? He stopped in an old industrial park in Brooklyn. What? That makes no sense. He said he was going out of town.  Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy. Don\\'t think he likes you, by the way. It sounded like he was catching a flight. He said something about taking off in nine minutes. - What? - He was surrounded by boxes. Boxes? It\\'s moving day. It\\'s moving day. He\\'s gonna rob that plane. I gotta stop him! All right, wheels up in eight minutes. We just got to load Tony\\'s old Hulkbuster Armor... ...prototype for Cap\\'s new shield, and the Meging-- The Meg-- The-- Thor\\'s magic belt. Okay, slow down. You\\'re getting close. It\\'s on your right. - What? - Turn right. - Peter. Are you okay? - Yeah. Just keep trying to get through to Happy. It\\'s been an honor, Spider-Man. What are you doing here? There\\'s a dance. I\\'m... ...looking... ...at porn. Hey! Surprised? Oh, hey, Pete. I didn\\'t hear you come in. It\\'s over. I\\'ve got you. You know, I gotta tell you, Pete... ...I really, really admire your grit. I see why Liz likes you. I do. When you first came to the house... ...I wasn\\'t sure. I thought, \"Really?\" But I get it now. How could you do this to her? To her? I\\'m not doing anything to her, Pete. I\\'m doing this for her. Yeah. Peter... ...you\\'re young. You don\\'t understand how the world works. But I understand that selling weapons to criminals is wrong. How do you think your buddy Stark paid for that tower? Or any of his little toys? Those people, Pete, those people up there... ...the rich and the powerful, they do whatever they want. Guys like us... ...like you and me... ...they don\\'t care about us. We build their roads, and we fight all their wars... ...and everything, but they don\\'t care about us. We have to pick up after them. We have to eat their table scraps. That\\'s how it is. I know you know what I\\'m talking about, Peter.  Why are you telling me this? Because I want you to understand. And... ...I needed a little time to get her airborne. I\\'m sorry, Peter. What are you talking about? That thing hasn\\'t even touched me yet. True. Then again... ...wasn\\'t really trying to. Chief, they\\'re powering up engines. - Okay. Yeah, yeah. - Come on, come on, come on. Okay, ready? Hello? Hello! Please, hey. Hey, please. I\\'m down here. I\\'m down here. I\\'m stuck. I\\'m stuck. I can\\'t move. I can\\'t-- If you\\'re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn\\'t have it. Come on, Peter. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man! Launch for intercept. Green light. Green light. Oh, yeah. Retroreflective panels engaged. Got a visual on the plane, but I\\'m feeling a little resistance. It\\'s probably just drag on the new turbines. Look out for the cloaking cameras. Stay in the blind spots. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Deploying high-altitude vacuum seal. This better work, Mason. Trust me, boss, even one of those boxes and we are set for life. Yeah. You have 30 seconds to get to the cockpit... ...and override their security. Cloning transponder signal. Launching decoy drone. Entering new coordinates. Good, so it\\'s on its way. - Yes, sir, right on course. - Okay, thank you. All right. Hot dog. Just a typical homecoming... ...on the outside of an invisible jet... ...fighting my girlfriend\\'s dad. Oh, God! I can\\'t believe that worked. Chief, they\\'re losing altitude. Get out of there. I\\'m not going home empty-handed. Oh, my God. - Get out of there. What are you doing? - Please turn, please turn! Hey, Pedro. Bingo. Your wingsuit. Your wingsuit\\'s going to explode! Time to go home, Pete. I\\'m trying to save you! No. No.  It looked so insane. That whole-- Like, it was just crazy. He-- He was just, like... And you were like... And then I just hit him with the... It was so-- Oh, my God. I mean, you saved me. It was awesome. Hey, Liz. I\\'m gonna miss you. Bye. Liz. Liz, look, I\\'m so sorry. You say that a lot. What are you sorry for this time? The dance? That was a pretty crappy thing to do. Well, yeah, but I-- I mean, your dad-- I can\\'t imagine what you\\'re going through. If there\\'s anything I can do to help... I guess we\\'re moving to Oregon. Mom says it\\'s nice there, so that\\'s cool. Anyways, Dad doesn\\'t want us here during the trial. So... Liz, I-- I-- Bye, Peter. Whatever\\'s going on with you, I hope you figure it out. Congratulations, decathlon national champions. Yeah! I\\'ll have to put this back in the trophy case soon... ...but just for motivation right now at this practice. I\\'m ahead of the game, but we will need... ...a new team captain next year. So I am appointing Michelle. Yeah! Thank you. My-- My friends call me MJ. I thought you didn\\'t have any friends. I didn\\'t. - I gotta go. - Hey, where you going? What are you hiding, Peter? I\\'m just kidding. I don\\'t care. Bye. - All right, so we should run some drills. - Yeah. Hey, Happy. What-- ? What are you doing here? I really owe you one. I don\\'t know what I would do without this job. I mean, before I met Tony-- So how long you been here? Long enough to be awkward. Boss wants to see you. - Is he here too? - In the toilet? No, he\\'s upstate. Upstate-- Like, upstate-upstate? Yeah, let\\'s go. Take a look. It\\'s pretty impressive, huh? They just finished remodeling the whole thing. - You don\\'t see that every day. - Oh, there they are. How was the ride up? - Good. - Give me a minute with the kid.  - Seriously? - Yeah. I gotta talk to the kid. I\\'ll be close behind. How about a loose follow? All right? Boundaries are good. Sorry I took your suit. You had it coming. Actually, it turns out it was... ...the perfect tough-love moment that you needed. To urge you on, right? Wouldn\\'t you think? Don\\'t you think? - I guess. - Let\\'s just say it was. - Mr. Stark, I really-- - You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime. But then you did the right thing. Took the dog to the free clinic, you raised the hybrid puppies... All right, not my best analogy. I was wrong about you. I think, with a little more mentoring... ...you could be a real asset to the team. - To the-- ? To the team? - Yeah. Anyway... ...there\\'s about 50 reporters behind that door. Real ones, not bloggers. When you\\'re ready... ...why don\\'t you try that on? And I\\'ll introduce the world to the newest official member of the Avengers: Spider-Man. \\'Can- Yeah, give that a look. After the press conference, Happy will show you to your room... ...your new quarters. Where\\'s he between? He\\'s next to Vision? - Yeah, Vision\\'s not big on doors. - It\\'s fun. Or walls. You\\'ll fit right in. Thank you, Mr. Stark. But I\\'m good. You\\'re good? Good-- ? How are you good? Well, I mean, I\\'d rather just stay on the ground for a little while. Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Somebody\\'s got to look out for the little guy, right? You\\'re turning me down? You better think about this. Look at that. Look at me. Last chance. Yes or no? - No. - Okay. It\\'s kind of a Springsteen-y, working-class hero vibe that I dig. Happy will take you home. - Yeah? - Yeah. Mind waiting in the car? I need a minute. - Thank you, Mr. Stark. - Yes, Mr. Parker, very well. - See you around.  - Okay. That was a test, right? - There\\'s nobody back there? - Yes, you passed. - All right, skedaddle there, young buck. - Thank you, Mr. Stark. Yeah, thank you. Told you he\\'s a good kid. - Where\\'s the kid? - He left. - Everybody\\'s waiting. - He actually made a mature choice. - It just surprised the heck out of us. - Did you screw this up? - He told the kid to go wait in the car. - Are you kidding? I have a room full of people in there waiting... ...for some big announcement. What will I tell them? Think of something. How about...? - Hap, you still got that ring? - Do I-- ? I-- ? - The engagement ring. - Are you kidding? I\\'ve been carrying this since 2008. Okay. I think I can think of something better than that. Well, it would buy us a little time. Like we need time. I can\\'t believe you have that in your pocket. - Want me to get the door for you, hon? - I got it. Aunt May, did you do dinner already? May? What \\'the-l?! Look who it is. What are the odds you and I\\'d end up at the same summer camp? Relax. This? It\\'s not on you. It\\'s on our little spider friend. I\\'ve got some boys on the outside who would love to meet him. You know, take a picture, slice his throat, put his head in a dryer. And I heard a rumor. You know who he is. If I knew who he was... ...he\\'d already be dead. Toomes, your family\\'s here! Hi, I\\'m Captain America, here to talk to you... ...about one of the most valuable traits a soldier or student can have. Patience. Sometimes patience is the key to victory. Sometimes it leads to very little... ...and it seems like it\\'s not worth it. And you wonder... ...why you waited so long for something so disappointing. How many more of these? '],\n",
       " 'Thor Ragnarok': ['(MUSIC PLAYING)  THOR: Now, I know what you\\'re thinking.  \"Oh, no! Thor\\'s in a cage. How did this happen?\"  Well, sometimes you have to get captured  just to get a straight answer out of somebody.  It\\'s a long story,  but basically, I\\'m a bit of a hero.  See, I spent some time on Earth...  fought some robots,  saved the planet a couple of times.  Then I went searching through the cosmos  for some magic, colourful Infinity Stone things.  Didn\\'t find any.  That\\'s when I came across  a path of death and destruction...  which led me all the way here into this cage...  where I met you.  Hmm.  How much longer do you think we\\'ll be here?  (CHAIN RATTLING)  (GRUNTS)  (SURTUR CHUCKLING)  Thor, son of Odin.  Surtur, son of a bitch.  You\\'re still alive.  I thought my father killed you a half a million years ago.  I cannot die.  Not until I fulfil my destiny...  and lay waste to your home.  It\\'s funny you should mention that.  Because I\\'ve been having these terrible dreams of late.  Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins.  And you, Surtur,  are at the centre of all of them.  Then you have seen Ragnarok, the fall of Asgard.  - The great prophecy... - Hang on.  - Hang on. -(CHAIN CREAKING)  I\\'ll be back around shortly.  I really feel like we were connecting there.  (GRUNTS)  Okay, so Ragnarok.  Tell me about that. Walk me through it.  My time has come.  When my crown is reunited with the Eternal Flame...  I shall be restored to my full might.  I will tower over the mountains...  and bury my sword deep in Asgard\\'s...  THOR: Oh, hang on. Give it a second.  I swear I\\'m not even moving.  It\\'s just doing this on its own.  - I\\'m really sorry. -(SIGHS)  Okay, so let me get this straight.  You\\'re going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame...  and then you\\'ll suddenly grow as big as a house?  A mountain!  The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard?  Odin is not on Asgard.  And your absence has left the throne defenseless.  Okay, so where is it? This crown?  This is my crown, the source of my power.  Oh, that\\'s a crown.  I thought it was a big eyebrow.  It\\'s a crown.  Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok...  is rip that thing off your head.  (LAUGHS) But Ragnarok has already begun.  You cannot stop it.  (METAL SCRAPING)  I am Asgard\\'s doom, and so are you.  All will suffer, all will burn.  Oh, that\\'s intense.  To be honest, seeing you grow really big...  and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle.  But it looks like I\\'m gonna have to choose option B...  where I bust out of these chains...  knock that tiara off your head,  and stash it away in Asgard\\'s vault.  You cannot stop Ragnarok.  Why fight it?  Because that\\'s what heroes do.  (THOR SIGHS) Hmm.  Wait, I\\'m sorry. I didn\\'t time that right.  -(DISTANT THUDDING) - Hmm?  And, now!  (GRUNTS)  (IMMIGRANT SONG BY LED ZEPPELIN PLAYING)  You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.  I make grave mistakes all the time.  (GROWLING)  Everything seems to work out.

Now, the job ain\\'t easy...  but it does have its benefits.  The Bifrost gives me access to everything  the Nine Realms has to offer.  I mean it\\'s all mine for the taking.  Behold...  my stuff.  Ooh.  I\\'m particularly fond of these.  I pulled them out of a place on Midgard called Texas.  I even named them. Des and Troy.  You see, when you put them together...  they destroy.  (ROARING)  Heimdall, come on.  (RUMBLING)  (ROARING)  Stay!  Heimdall? I\\'m running short on options.  - Heimdall? -(RATTLING)  Um... Skurge?  (RATTLING)  Is that important?

Thanks for scaring away my company  and drenching my workplace in brains.  Who are you?  Don\\'t you remember? I\\'m Skurge.  We fought together on Vanaheim.  Right. Where is Heimdall?  That traitor. No one knows. He\\'s a fugitive of the throne.  Traitor?  Yeah. Well, you see, Odin charged Heimdall  with negligence of duty...  but he disappeared before the trial.

I\\'m sorry about that thing with the Tesseract.  - I just couldn\\'t help myself. - I know.  I\\'m a trickster.  So mischievous.  Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog.  It was a wonderful joke.  \\'Twas indeed hilarious. (CHUCKLES)  MAN 2: You are the saviour of Asgard.  - Tell my story. - I will.  Build a statue for me.  We will build a big statue for you.

(SOBBING)  And so, Loki died of his wounds...  giving his life for ours.  He fought back those disgusting elves...  he brought peace to the realm.  Loki, my boy...  \\'twas many moons ago I found you  on that frostbitten battlefield.  On that day, I did not yet see in you...  Asgard\\'s saviour. No.  You were merely a little blue baby icicle...  that melted this old fool\\'s heart.  (AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)  Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.  Father.  Oh, shit.  Uh, my son, Thor, has returned!  - Greetings, my boy. -(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)  It\\'s an interesting play. What\\'s it called?  The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.  The people wanted to commemorate him.  THOR: Ah, indeed they should.  I like the statue.  A lot better looking than he was when he was alive, though.  A little less weasely, less greasy, maybe.  Do you know what this is?  The skull of Surtur. That\\'s a formidable weapon!  Do me a favour. Lock this away in a vault...  so it doesn\\'t turn into a giant monster  and destroy the whole planet.  Thank you, dear. Um...  So it\\'s back to Midgard for you, is it?  Nope.  I\\'ve been having this reoccurring dream lately.  Every night, I see Asgard fall into ruins.  ODIN: That\\'s just a silly dream...  signs of an overactive imagination.  THOR: Possibly.  But then I decide to go out there and investigate.  And what do I find,  but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.  Enemies of Asgard assembling, plotting our demise...  all while you, Odin,  the protector of those Nine Realms...  are sitting here in your bathrobe,  eating grapes.  Yes, it is best to respect our neighbours\\' freedom.  Yes, of course, the freedom to be massacred.  Yes, besides I\\'ve been rather busy myself.  Watching theatre.  Board meetings, and security council meetings...  You\\'re really gonna make me do it?  Do what?  (ALL GASP)  You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir  as it returns to my hand.  Not even your face.  You\\'ve gone quite mad. You\\'ll be executed for this.  Then I\\'ll see you on the other side, brother.  All right, I yield.  (ALL GASP)  Behold!  Thor...  - Odinson. - No.  You had one job. Just the one.  Where\\'s Odin?  You just couldn\\'t stay away, could you?  Everything was fine without you.  Asgard was prospering. You\\'ve ruined everything.  - Ask them. - Where\\'s Father?  - Did you kill him? - You had what you wanted.  You had the independence you asked for.  (GRUNTS) Whoa, whoa, whoa!  Okay. I know exactly where he is.  (SIRENS BLARING IN DISTANCE)  I swear I left him right here.  THOR: Right here on the sidewalk,  or right there where the building is being demolished?  Great planning.  How was I supposed to know?  Can\\'t see into the future. I\\'m not a witch.  No? Then why do you dress like one?  - Hey. - I can\\'t believe you\\'re alive.  I saw you die.  I mourned you, I cried for you.  I\\'m honoured.  GIRL: Ask him.  Hi. Would you mind taking a picture with us?  - Oh, sure. -(GIRLS GIGGLING)  Start figuring out where he is.  -(CAMERA CLICKS) - GIRL: Oh, my God.  Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.  She didn\\'t dump me, you know.  I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.  What\\'s this? What are you doing?  This isn\\'t me.  (YELPS)  THOR: (WHISPERS) Loki.  (HORN HONKS)  (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)  Thor Odinson.  God of Thunder.  You can put down the umbrella.  (mums)  So, Earth has, uh, wizards now?  {CHUCKUNG) -(CLATTERING)  The preferred term is  \"Master of the Mystic Arts.\" You can leave that now.  All right, wizard.  Who are you? Why should I care?  My name is Doctor Stephen Strange,  and I have some questions for you.  Take a seat.  Tea?  I don\\'t drink tea.  What do you drink?  Not tea.  So, I keep a watch list  of individuals and beings from other realms...  that may be a threat to this world.  Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings.  He\\'s a worthy inclusion. Hmm.  Then why bring him here?  We\\'re looking for my father.  So, if I were to tell you where Odin was...  all parties concerned would promptly return to Asgard?  Promptly.  Great! Then I\\'ll help you.  If you knew where he was, why didn\\'t you call me?  I have to tell you, he was adamant  that he not be disturbed.  Your father said he had chosen to remain in exile.  - Hmm. - And you don\\'t have a phone.  No, I don\\'t have a phone...  but you could have sent an electronic letter.  It\\'s called an email.  - Yeah, do you have a computer? - No. What for?  - Uh-huh. - Anyway,  my father is no longer in exile.  So if you could tell me where he is,  I can take him home.  Gladly. He\\'s in Norway.  I\\'m just seeing whether this incantation  requires any Asgardian modifications.  Nope.  Oh, we don\\'t need that.  (SIGHS)  Will you stop doing that?  (STAMMERS)  I need just one strand of your hair.  Let me explain something.  My hair is not to be meddled with. (WINCES)  We could have just walked.  He\\'s waiting for you.  All right.  Don\\'t forget your umbrella.  Oh, yes.  (DISTANT CRASHING)  (CRASHING CONTINUES)  Sorry.  There we go.  I suppose I\\'ll need my brother back.  Oh, yeah. Right.  (LOKI SCREAMING)  (LOKI GRUNTING)  I have been falling for 30 minutes!  You can handle him from here.  Yes. Of course.  Thank you very much for your help.  Good luck.  Handle me? Who are you?  Loki.  LOKI: You think you\\'re some kind of sorcerer?  Don\\'t think for one minute, you second-rate...  Bye-bye.  (LOKI GRUNTING)  (PANTING)  (BIRDS CHIRPING)  Father?  Look at this place. It\\'s beautiful.  Father, it\\'s us.  My sons.  I\\'ve been waiting for you.  I know. We\\'ve come to take you home.  Home, yes.  Your mother, she calls me.  Do you hear it?  Loki, lift your magic.  (CHUCKLES)  Took me quite a while to break free from your spell.  Frigga would have been proud.  Come and sit with me. I don\\'t have much time.  (ODIN SIGHS)  I know that we failed you.  But we can make this right.  I failed you.  It is upon us. Ragnarok.  No, I\\'ve stopped Ragnarok. I put an end to Surtur.  No.  It has already begun. She\\'s coming.  My life was all that held her back.  But my time has come.  I cannot keep her away any longer.  Father, who are you talking about?  Goddess of Death. Hela.  My firstborn.  Your sister.  Your what?  Her violent appetites grew beyond my control.  I couldn\\'t stop her, so I imprisoned her.  Locked her away.  She draws her strength from Asgard...  and once she gets there, her powers will be limitless.  Whatever she is, we can stop her together.  We can face her together.  No, we won\\'t.  I\\'m on a different path now.  This you must face alone.  I love you, my sons.  Look at that.  Remember this place.  Home.  (SOMBRE MUSIC PLAYING)  (THUNDER RUMBLING)  (WIND HOWLING)  (THUNDER RUMBLING)  Brother.  (ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)  (BREATHING HEAVILY)  This was your doing.  (THUNDER RUMBLING)  (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)  So he\\'s gone.  That\\'s a shame. I would\\'ve liked to have seen that.  You must be Hela.  I\\'m Thor, son of Odin.  Really? You don\\'t look like him.  Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.  You sound like him.  Kneel.  Beg your pardon?  Kneel.  Before your queen.  I don\\'t think so.  (GRUNTS)  (VIBRATING)  It\\'s not possible.  Darling, you have no idea what\\'s possible.  (BOTH GROANING)  (BOTH PANTING)  Bring us back!  No!  Loki!  (LOKI SCREAMING)  (THOR GRUNTS)  Who are you? What have you done with Thor?  (YELLS)  (GROANS)  I\\'m Hela.  I\\'m just a janitor.  You look like a smart boy with good survival instincts.  How would you like a job?  (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)  (GRUNTS)  (GROANING)  (DISTANT THUDDING)  (THUNDER CRACKS)  (ALARM BLARING)  Are you a fighter?  Or are you food?  I\\'m just passing through.  It is food.  On your knees.  (COCKS GUN)  -(SCRAPPER SCREAMS) -(GRUNTS)  (GROANING)  (ENGINE WHIRRING)  (ALL EXCLAIM)  -(GLASS SHATTERS) - He\\'s mine.  Wait!  (SQUELCHES)  Wait!  He\\'s mine.  So if you want him, you go through me.  But we\\'ve already got him.  All right, then. I guess I go through you.  -(COCKS GUN) - More food.  (INDISTINCT CHATTERING)  (POWERING UP)  (ALL SCREAMING)  (SIGHS)  (PANTING)  (GRUNTING)  (SCRAPPER SCREAMS)  -(DISTANT CRASH) - Thank you.  (GROANS)  (GROANS)  Scrapper 142. I need clearance and an audience with the boss.  I\\'ve got something special.  Hey! Where are you taking me?  Answer me!  Hey!  I am Thor, son of Odin. I need to get back to Asgard.  - Many apologies, your majesty. -(DEVICE BEEPING)  (GROANING)  It\\'s come to my attention that you don\\'t know who I am.  I am Hela, Odin\\'s firstborn...  the commander of the Legions of Asgard...  the rightful heir to the throne,  and the Goddess of Death.  My father is dead.  As are the princes. You\\'re welcome.  We were once the seat  of absolute power in the cosmos.  Our supremacy was unchallenged.  Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.  Our destiny is to rule over all others.  And I am here to restore that power.  Kneel before me...  and rise into the ranks of my great conquest.  Whoever you are...  whatever you\\'ve done, surrender now!  Or we will show you no mercy.  Whoever I am?  Did you listen to a word I said?  This is your last warning!  I thought you\\'d be happy to see me.  (SIGHS)  Fine.  (GRUNTING)  SOLDIER: Charge!  (ALL YELLING)  (MEN GROANING)  (GUNS FIRING)  (MEN GROANING)  (BONES CRUNCHING)  (GRUNTS)  Oh, I\\'ve missed this.  Still, it\\'s a shame.  Good soldiers dying for nothing...  all because they couldn\\'t see the future.  Sad.  -(HOGUN GROANING) - Oh, look, still alive.  (GROANING)  Change of heart?  Go back to whatever cave you crept out of.  You evil demoness!  (GROANS)  HELA: Let\\'s go see my palace.  (DOOR OPENS)  (MACHINERY POWERING UP)  FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Fear not, for you are found.  You are home, and there is no going back.  (STRAINS)  No one leaves this place.  But what is this place?  The answer is Sakaar.  (SWEEPING MUSIC PLAYING)  Surrounded by cosmic gateways...  Sakaar lives on the edge of the known and unknown.  It is the collection point  for all lost and unloved things...  like you.  But here on Sakaar, you are significant.  You are valuable.  Here you are loved.  What the hell?  And no one loves you more than the Grandmaster.  He is the original,  the first lost and the first found...  the creator of Sakaar...  and father of the Contest of Champions.  Where once you were nothing, now you are something.  You are the property of the Grandmaster.  Congratulations!  You will meet the Grandmaster in 5 seconds.  Prepare yourself.  Prepare yourself.  You are now meeting the Grandmaster.  (SCREAMING)  Hmm, hmm, hmm.  (STRAINING)  He\\'s wonderful. It is a he?  It is a he.  Yeah.  I love when you come to visit, 142.  You bring me the best stuff.  Whenever we get to talking, Topaz,  about Scrapper 142...  what do I always say?  \"She is the...\" And it starts with a  Trash.  No, not trash.  Were you waiting just to call her that?  It doesn\\'t start with a  Booze hag.  Uh, I\\'m so sorry. No, \"best.\" I was thinking about \"best.\"  \\'Cause I always say you\\'re the best.  She brought me my beloved champion, you know.  You say that every time she\\'s here.  What have you brought today? Tell me.  A contender.  A what?  I need to go closer. I want a closer look at this.  Can you take us closer? Thank you.  (SNAPPING FINGERS)  Pay this lady.  Just wait a damn minute.  (STRAINING) I\\'m not for sale.  (GRUNTS)  (GROANING)  (CHUCKLES) Man, he\\'s a fighter.  I take 10 million.  Tell her she\\'s dreaming.  Oh, for heaven\\'s sakes, transfer the units.  (DEVICE BEEPS)  (WEAKLY) You\\'ll pay for this.  No, I got paid for this.  - Here\\'s what I wanna know. -(DEVICE BEEPS)  Who are you?  I am the God of Thunder.  -(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES) - Wow.  I didn\\'t hear any thunder,  but out of your fingers, was that sparkles?  We\\'ve located your cousin.  Uh,oh,good!  Yeah, come on. I think you\\'re gonna like this.  There he is.  Hey, cuz.  We almost couldn\\'t find you. What, you been hiding?  Hi.  -(GROANS) - GRANDMASTER: Hmm.  So...  Please.  (GROANS) I\\'m sorry.  Yeah.  Carlo...  I pardon you.  (SIGHS) Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  You\\'re officially pardoned. From life.  -(SCREAMING) -(SIZZLING)  (GROANS) Help me.  Oh, my God!  I\\'m stepping in it. I\\'m stepping in it. Look!  Wow.  Oh, the smell.  What does it smell like?  - Burnt toast. -(CHUCKLES)  What happened to my manners?  Ihaven% properly introduced myself.  Come on. Uh, follow me.  -(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) - My name is Grandmaster.  I preside over a little harlequinade  called the Contest of Champions.  People come from far and wide  to unwillingly participate in it.  And you, my friend,  might just be part of the new cast.  What do you say to that?  We\\'re not friends and I don\\'t give a shit about your games.  I\\'m going back to Asgard.  - Ass-gard. -(MUSIC CONTINUES)  One, two, three, four.  LOKI: There was a wormhole in space and time beneath me.  At that moment, I let go. (LAUGHS)  Loki?  Loki! Loki!  - Over here. Over here. -(LAUGHING)  - Excuse me one second. - Loki!  -(SHUSHING) -(BOTH WHISPERING)  - What? - You\\'re alive?  - Yes, of course I\\'m alive. - What are you doing here?  What do you mean, what am I doing?  I\\'m stuck in this stupid chair.  - Where\\'s your chair? - I didn\\'t get a chair.  - Get me out of this one. - I can\\'t.  - Get me out. What? - I can\\'t.  I\\'ve made friends with this man.  He\\'s called the Grandmaster.  - Oh, he\\'s crazy! - I\\'ve gained his favour.  The Bifrost brought me out here weeks ago.  - Weeks ago? - Yes.  I just got here.  (WHISPERS) What are you whispering about?  (YELPS)  Time works real different around these parts.  On any other world, I\\'d be, like, millions of years old.  But here on Sakaar...  (MUSIC CONTINUES)  In any case, you know this, uh...  You call yourself Lord of Thunder?  God of Thunder. Tell him.  I\\'ve never met this man in my life.  - He\\'s my brother. - Adopted.  Is he any kind of a fighter?  (LAUGHS) You take this thing  out of my neck and I\\'ll show you.  Now, listen to that. He\\'s threatening me.  Hey, Sparkles, here\\'s the deal.  If you wanna get back to Ass-place, Assberg...  Asgard.  Any contender who defeats my champion...  their freedom they shall win.  Fine. Then point me in the direction  of whoever\\'s ass I have to kick!  That\\'s what I call, contender.  Direction would be this way, Lord.  Ah! Loki!  (GRUNTING)  Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, man.  -(PANTING) - Over here.  The pile of rocks waving at you. Here.  Yeah, I\\'m actually a thing. I\\'m a being.  Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Korg.  I\\'m kind of like the leader in here.  I\\'m made of rocks, as you can see.  But don\\'t let that intimidate you.  You don\\'t need to be afraid  unless you\\'re made of scissors. (CHUCKLES)  Just a little rock-paper-scissor  joke for you.  This is my very good friend over here, Miek.  He\\'s an insect and has knives for hands.  You\\'re a Kronan, aren\\'t you?  - That I am. - How\\'d you end up in here?  Ah, well, I tried to start a revolution,  but didn\\'t print enough pamphlets.  So hardly anyone turned up,  except for my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate.  As punishment, I was forced  to be in here and become a gladiator.  Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.  But I\\'m actually organising another revolution.  I don\\'t know if you\\'d be interested  in something like that.  Do you reckon you\\'d be interested?  How did you...  Ah, yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle.  But not a real circle, more like a freaky circle.  This doesn\\'t make any sense.  No, nothing makes sense here, man.  The only thing that does make sense  is that nothing makes sense.  Has anyone here fought the Grandmaster\\'s champion?  Doug has.  Doug!  Our luck, Doug\\'s dead.  That\\'s right.  Everyone who fights  the Grandmaster\\'s champion perishes.  What about you? You\\'re made of rocks.  Perishable rock. There you go. Another one gone.  Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights,  warm up the crowd and whatnot.  Wait. You\\'re not gonna face him, are you?  Yes, I am.  Gonna fight him, win,  and get the hell out of this place.  That\\'s exactly what Doug used to say.  See you later, new Doug.  Does no one remember me?  Has no one been taught our history?  Look at these lies.  Goblets and garden parties?  Peace treaties?  Odin...  proud to have it...  ashamed of how he got it.  (GRUNTING)  We were unstoppable.  I was his weapon in the conquest  that built Asgard\\'s empire.  One by one, the realms became ours.  But then, simply because my ambition outgrew his...  he banished me, caged me, locked me away like an animal.  Before that, Asgard\\'s warriors were honoured...  their bodies buried as heroes beneath this very palace.  - Odin\\'s treasures. - Fake.  (CLATTERS)  Most of the stuff in here is fake.  Or weak.  Smaller than I thought it would be.  That\\'s not bad.  (GASPS) But this...  The Eternal Flame.  (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)  Want to see what true power really looks like?  (mums)  Fenris, my darling, what have they done to you?  With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.  (GROWLING)  I\\'ve missed you.  I\\'ve missed you all.  THOR: Odin...  I bid you take your place in the halls of Valhalla...  where the brave shall live forever.  Nor shall we mourn but rejoice...  for those that have died...  THOR AND LOKI: ...the glorious death.  Hurts, doesn\\'t it?  Being lied to.  Being told you\\'re one thing  and then learning it\\'s all a fiction.  You didn\\'t think I\\'d really come and see you, did you?  This place is disgusting.  (ROCK CLATTERS)  Does this mean you don\\'t want my help?  Look, I couldn\\'t jeopardise my position with the Grandmaster.  It took me time to win his trust.  He\\'s a lunatic, but he can be amenable.  What I\\'m telling you is,  you could join me at the Grandmaster\\'s side.  Perhaps, in time,  an accident befalls the Grandmaster, and then...  (MOUTHING WORDS)  (ROCK CLATTERS)  You\\'re not seriously thinking of going back, are you?  Our sister destroyed your hammer  like a piece of glass.  She\\'s stronger than both of us. She\\'s stronger than you.  You don\\'t stand a chance.  Do you understand what I\\'m saying to you?  (SCOFFS)  Fine.  I guess I\\'ll just have to go it alone.  Like I\\'ve always done.  Would you say something?  Say something!  What would you like me to say?  You faked your own death...  you stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power...  stranded him on Earth to die,  releasing the Goddess of Death.  Have I said enough or would you like me to go back  further than the past two days?  You know, I haven\\'t seen this  beloved champion he talks of...  but I\\'ve heard he is astonishingly savage.  I\\'ve placed a large wager against you tomorrow.  Don\\'t let me down.  (GLASS SHATTERS)  KORG: Piss off, ghost!  He\\'s freaking gone.  (INDISTINCT CHATTERING)  KORG: Oh, yuck!  There\\'s still someone\\'s hair and blood all over this.  Guys, can you clean up the weapons  once you finish your fight?  Disgusting slobs.  Oh, Thor...  wanna use a big wooden fork?  No.  Yeah, not really useful.  Unless you\\'re fighting off three vampires  that were huddled together.  I really wish I had my hammer.  Hammer?  Quite unique. It was made from this  special metal from the heart of a dying star.  And when I spun it really, really fast,  it gave me the ability to fly.  You rode a hammer?  No, I didn\\'t ride the hammer.  The hammer rode you on your back?  No. I used to spin it really fast,  and it would pull me off the...  Oh, my God. A hammer pulled you off?  The ground. It would pull me off the ground,  up into the air, and I would fly.  Every time I threw it,  it would always come back to me.  Sounds like you had a pretty special  and intimate relationship with this hammer...  and that losing it  was almost comparable to losing a loved one.  That\\'s a nice way of putting it.  I said they\\'re mine.  See her, that\\'s the one that put me in here.  Oh, yeah. Scrapper 142.  Gotta watch out for those Asgardians, man.  They are hard to perish.  Asgardian?  Hey. HEY-  Hey.  Do not zap me with that thing. I just wanna talk.  Asgard is in danger.  My God, you\\'re a Valkyrie.  I used to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was younger...  until I found out that you were all women.  There\\'s nothing wrong with women, of course.  I love women.  Sometimes a little too much.  Not in a creepy way,  just more of a respectful appreciation.  I think it\\'s great that there is  an elite force of women warriors.  It\\'s about time.  Are you done?  WARDEN: Lord of Thunder, you\\'re up.  Please, help me. I need your help.  Bye.  Fine, then you must be a traitor or a coward.  Because the Valkyrie is sworn to protect the throne.  Listen closely, your majesty. This is Sakaar, not Asgard.  And I\\'m a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.  -(DEVICE BEEPS) -(GROANING)  Bring him in for processing.  And no one escapes this place. So you\\'re gonna die anyway.  BARBER: Now, don\\'t you move.  My hands ain\\'t as steady as they used to be.  By Odin\\'s beard, you shall not cut my hair...  lest you feel the wrath of the mighty Thor.  (WHIRRING)  Please. Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair.  (BARBER LAUGHS)  Please! No!  No!  (AUDIENCE CHEERING)  Wow! Look at all of you. (LAUGHS)  What a show! What a night!  Who\\'s having fun?  Please, I\\'m your host.  Big round of applause  for all of our undercard competitors...  who today died so gruesomely.  Good sports.  What a show! What a night!  This is what you\\'ve come for, and so have I.  And now, without further ado...  it\\'s main event time.  (AUDIENCE CHEERING)  Making his first appearance,  though he looks quite promising...  got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.  I\\'ll say no more, see what you think.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...  Lord of Thunder.  (AUDIENCE BOOING AND SHOUTING)  Watch out for his fingers. They make sparks.  Okay, this is it.  Let\\'s get ready to welcome this guy. Here he comes.  -(FIREWORKS BURSTING) -(AUDIENCE CHEERING)  (RUMBLING)  GRANDMASTER: He is a creature.  What can we say about him?  Well, he\\'s unique. There\\'s none like him.  I feel a special connection with him.  He\\'s undefeated.  He\\'s the reigning.  He\\'s the defending.  Ladies and gentlemen...  1 give you...  Uh-oh.  ...your Incredible...  (ROARING)  Hulk!  Yes!  (CHEERING DIES DOWN)  I have to get off this planet.  Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?  -(YELLING) -(AUDIENCE CHEERING)  (AUDIENCE CHANTING)  Hey!  We know each other.  He\\'s a friend from work.  (LOKI CLEARS THROAT)  Where have you been?  Everybody thought you were dead.  But so much has happened since I last saw you.  I lost my hammer.  Like, yesterday, so that\\'s still pretty fresh.  Loki. Loki\\'s alive. Can you believe it?  He\\'s up there.  Loki! Look who it is!  Banner, I never thought I would say this...  but I\\'m happy to see you.  AUDIENCE: (CHANTING) Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!  THOR: Banner.  Hey,Banner!  No Banner. Only Hulk.  What are you doing?  - It\\'s me. It\\'s Thor! -(GROWLS)  (YELLING)  (ROARS)  Banner, we\\'re friends.  This is crazy. I don\\'t want to hurt you!  -(AUDIENCE CHEERING) - Here we go.  (HULK GRUNTS)  What?  (AUDIENCE MURMURING)  Hey, big guy-  The sun\\'s getting real low.  (GRUNTING)  (SHUSHING)  That\\'s it. The sun\\'s going down.  I won\\'t hurt you any more.  No one will.  (YELPS)  (AUDIENCE CHEERING)  (ROARING)  Yes! That\\'s how it feels!  (LOKI CHUCKLES)  I\\'m just a huge fan of the sport.  (LAUGHING)  (AUDIENCE CHANTING)  (ROARS)  All right. Screw it.  (AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING)  AUDIENCE: Oh!  (AUDIENCE GASPS)  I know you\\'re in there, Banner.  I\\'ll get you out!  (AUDIENCE CLAMOURING)  (ROARS)  What\\'s the matter with you? You\\'re embarrassing me!  I told them we were friends!  (THOR YELLING)  (YELLS)  (CLAMOURING STOPS)  (BREATHING HEAVILY)  -(THOR GRUNTS) -(AUDIENCE CHEERING)  (LAUGHS)  (THOR GRUNTING)  (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)  (AUDIENCE GASPS)  (GROANING)  (AUDIENCE GASPS)  (INDISTINCT MURMURING)  (BREATHING HEAVILY)  AUDIENCE: (CHANTING) Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!  Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!  (CHANTING CONTINUES)  (DEVICE BEEPS)  (AUDIENCE BOOING)  (ROARING)  (SIGHS)  Another day, another Doug.  (ROARS)  (THUDDING)  HELA: What is that noise?  The common folk aren\\'t exactly falling in line.  There\\'s a resistance trying to knock down the front gates.  (CREATURES GROWLING)  Tell me about yourself, Skurge.  Well, me dad was a stonemason. Me mum was...  Right, yeah, I\\'ll just stop you there.  What I meant was...  what\\'s your ambition?  I just want a chance to prove myself.  Recognition.  When I was young...  every great king had an executioner.  Not just to execute people...  but also to execute their vision.  But mainly to execute people.  Still, it was a great honour.  I was Odin\\'s executioner.  And you shall be my executioner.  Let\\'s begin our conquest.  (SWEEPING MUSIC PLAYING)  Skurge, where\\'s the sword?  That sword is the key to opening the Bifrost.  Those people you mentioned,  the ones who aren\\'t falling into line...  round them up.  (CREATURE SNARLS)  (PANTING)  (SNARLS)  Excuse me.  (CREATURE SNARLS)  Sorry about that.  These bloody things are everywhere.  Come on.  (RUMBLING)  You\\'ll be safe here.  -(YELLS) -(ALL GASP)  (GROANING)  (BREATHING HEAVILY)  (WATER SPLASHES)  Are we cool?  (GROWLS SOFTLY)  It\\'s Hulk in a hot tub.  So how long have you been like that?  Like what?  Like this. Big, and green, and stupid.  Hulk always Hulk.  How\\'d you get here?  Winning.  You mean cheating, huh?  Were they wearing one of these when you won?  How\\'d you arrive here?  (IMITATING WHOOSHING)  Quinjet.  Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?  That\\'s naked.  - He\\'s very naked. Hmm. -(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)  It\\'s in my brain now.  Quinjet.  Yes!  I\\'m getting us out of here.  This is a terrible, awful place.  You\\'re gonna love Asgard. It\\'s big. It\\'s golden. Shiny.  Hulk stay.  No, no, no. My people need me to get back to Asgard.  We must prevent Ragnarok.  Ragnarok?  The prophesied death of my home world.  The end of days, it\\'s the end of...  (YAWNING)  If you help me get back to Asgard...  I can help you get back to Earth. Huh?  Earth hate Hulk.  Earth loves Hulk. They love you.  You\\'re one of the Avengers.  One of the team, one of our friends.  This is what friends do. They support each other.  You\\'re Banner\\'s friend.  I\\'m not Banner\\'s friend. I prefer you.  Banner\\'s friend.  - I don\\'t even like Banner. -(SPITS)  \"I\\'m into numbers and science and stuff.\"  Thor go. Hulk stay.  Fine.  Stay here.  Stupid place. It\\'s hideous, by the way.  The red, the white. Just pick a colour. Ridiculous.  Smash you.  You didn\\'t smash anything. I won that fight.  - I smashed you. - Yeah, sure, sure.  - Baby arms. - What?  Baby.  Moron! You big child.  Thor gm!  - I am going. -(ALARM BEEPS)  -(GROANING) -(LAUGHING)  Thor go again.  (HULK LAUGHS)  Thor home.  Hulk trains.  That\\'s great. Have fun.  - Hey, big guy. - Angry girl.  What have you been up to?  HULK: Winning.  (VALKYRIE LAUGHS)  (THOR SIGHS)  Heimdall, I know you can see me.  I need you to help me.  Help me see.  I see you, but you\\'re far away.  What\\'s going on here?  Come see for yourself.  I\\'m providing refuge in a stronghold  built by our ancestors.  But if the garrison falls, our only escape is Bifrost.  You\\'re talking about evacuating Asgard?  (CREATURE SNARLS)  We won\\'t last long if we stay.  She draws her power from Asgard  and grows stronger every day.  Come on.  Hela is ravenous.  If I let her leave,  she\\'ll consume Nine Realms and all the cosmos.  We need you.  I\\'m working on it. But I don\\'t even know  where the hell I am.  You\\'re on a planet surrounded by doorways. Go through one.  - Which one? - The big one.  (CREATURE SNARLS)  (GASPING)  (GROANS)  (GRUNTS)  Thor sad.  Shut up.  Thor sad.  I\\'m not sad, you idiot.  - I\\'m pissed off! - Oh.  Angry. I lost my father.  - I lost my hammer. -(SCOFFS)  - You\\'re not even listening. - Whining and crying.  Cry like baby.  Don\\'t kick stuff.  You\\'re being a really bad friend.  You bad friend!  - You know what we call you? - No.  We call you the stupid Avenger.  You\\'re tiny Avenger! (GRUNTS)  What, are you crazy?  Yes.  You know what? Earth does hate you.  (WEAPON THUDS)  (GRUNTS)  (SIGHS)  No. Mmm-mmm.  I\\'m sorry I said those things.  You\\'re not the stupid Avenger.  Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.  It\\'s okay.  You just can\\'t go around throwing shields  at people. Could have killed me.  I know. I\\'m sorry.  I just get so angry all the time.  Hulk always, always angry.  I know. We\\'re the same, you and I.  We\\'re just a couple of hot-headed fools.  Yeah, same. Hulk like fire, Thor like water.  We\\'re kind of both like fire.  But Hulk like real fire.  Hulk like raging fire.  Thor like smouldering fire.  (CHUCKLES)  Hulk, I need you to do something for me.  Hmm?  (CHUCKLING)  Angry girl.  (LAUGHS)  (BOTH GRUNTING)  What\\'s going on? What are you...  (HULK GROANS)  You\\'re so thick-headed that you can\\'t tell...  when someone\\'s hiding all the way across  the universe and wants to be left alone.  - We need to talk. - No, you wanna talk to me.  I need her to stay.  Stay?  Block.  Sta)\\'-  - Please. - Please.  All right.  - Here\\'s the deal. -(BALL BOUNCING)  I\\'ll listen to you...  till this is empty.  Asgard is in danger and people are dying.  We need to get back there. I need your help.  Wow.  - Finished. Bye. -(GLASS SHATTERS)  Odin is dead.  Hela, the Goddess of Death, has invaded Asgard.  If Hela\\'s back, then Asgard\\'s already lost.  I\\'m going to stop her.  - Alone? - Nope.  I\\'m putting together a team.  It\\'s me, you, and the big guy.  No. No team. Only Hulk.  It\\'s me and you.  I think it\\'s only you.  Wait. Just listen. The Valkyrie are legend.  Elite warriors of Asgard sworn to defend the throne.  I\\'m not getting dragged into  another one of Odin\\'s family squabbles.  - What\\'s that supposed to mean? - Your sister.  Her power comes from Asgard, same as yours.  When it grew beyond Odin\\'s control  she massacred everyone in the palace...  and tried to seize the throne.  When she tried to escape her banishment...  he sent the Valkyrie in to fight her back.  I only survived because...  Look, I already faced her once  back when I believed in the throne...  and it cost me everything.  That\\'s what\\'s wrong with Asgard.  The throne, the secrets, the whole golden sham.  I agree.  Don\\'t get familiar.  (SIGHS) I agree.  That\\'s why I turned down the throne.  But this isn\\'t about the crown.  This is about the people.  They\\'re dying and they\\'re your people, too.  Forget it.  I have.  -Okay. -Okay.  - Good. Great. - Great.  Thank you.  - For what? - For this.  (CHUCKLES) Didn\\'t see that, did you?  (SIGHS)  -(DEVICE POWERS DOWN) - There... That\\'s better.  You know, go ahead.  Stay here and enslave people for that lunatic.  Keep drinking, keep hiding.  But me...  I choose to run toward my problems  and not away from them.  Because that\\'s what...  Because that\\'s what heroes do.  (UPBEAT ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)  Friend stay!  Yes!  (GRUNTS)  All right.  (BEEPING)  Come on.  COMPUTER: Welcome. Voice activation required.  - Thor. -(BEEPS)  Access denied.  Uh... Thor, son of Odin.  -(BEEPS) - Access denied.  God of Thunder.  -(BEEPS) - Access denied.  Strongest Avenger.  -(BEEPS) - Access denied.  (IN DEEP VOICE) Strongest Avenger.  -(BEEPS) - Access denied.  (SIGHS) Damn you, Stark.  Point Break.  - Welcome, Point Break. -(CHUCKLES)  -(POWERING UP) -(LAUGHS)  -(RUMBLING) - Friend stay!  No, no, no! Stop!  - Stay! -(QUINJET POWERS DOWN)  Stop! Stop breaking everything!  Don\\'t go!  Nice work, big guy.  We don\\'t know where Ultron\\'s headed,  but you\\'re going very high, very fast.  So, I need you to turn this bird around, okay?  We can\\'t track you in stealth mode...  so I need you to help me out. Okay?  (GRUNTING SOFTLY)  (DISTORTED) I need you to...  (GRUNTING)  (ROARS)  (GRUNTING)  No! No, Banner!  (EXHALES SHARPLY)  Oh, jeez.  Banner.  - Hey, hey, hey. -(GROANING)  - You all right, Banner? -(GASPS)  -(GASPING) -(SHUSHING)  Sun\\'s going down. Sun\\'s going down.  That\\'s it, breathe.  (EXHALES) I won\\'t hurt you.  - Sun\\'s going down. -(GROANS)  - Thor. - Yeah.  What happened to your hair?  Some creepy old man cut it off.  - It looks good. - Oh, thanks.  Where are we? Oh, how\\'s Nat?  - Uh, Nat is good, I\\'m sure. - Is she okay?  - And what about Sokovia? - Sokovia?  The city, Sokovia. Did we save it?  - Banner, listen. - What?  Sokovia. Ultron. That was two years ago.  - What are you saying? - Well...  What?  I\\'ve been Hulk for two years?  I\\'m afraid so.  (CLATTERS)  What the hell happened?  Banner, there\\'s something you should know.  (BEEPING)  COMPUTER: Voice activation required.  Banner.  Welcome, strongest Avenger.  Uh, What?  Ship\\'s log.  (CLATTERING)  (GRUNTING)  (ALARM BLARING)  Thor, where are we?  Yeah, about that.  GRANDMASTER: (ON SPEAKERS) Sakaar, hear ye.  Attention please. I have some bad news.  My beloved exalted champion has turned up missing.  Take to the streets. Celebrate my champion.  BANNER: Who\\'s that?  He kind of runs the place.  You actually lived at his house for a while.  - I did? - Yeah.  Quite a lot\\'s happened. You and I had a fight recently.  - Did I win? - No, l won. Easily.  Doesn\\'t sound right.  Well, it\\'s true.  It seems that that criminally seductive  Lord of Thunder has stolen him away.  Seductive God of Thunder. We need to move.  Oh, no.  (GRANDMASTER CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)  This is bad.  This is really, really bad.  Thor, I think I\\'m freaking out.  No,no,no.  Don\\'t freak out. You\\'re okay. Put these on.  These are Tony\\'s clothes.  - I know, come on. - Is he here?  No, he\\'s not here. But listen. Just stay calm, okay?  The sun\\'s going down. The sun\\'s getting really low.  Sun\\'s going down.  GRANDMASTER: I\\'m upset!  I\\'m very upset.  You know what I like about being upset? The blame.  Right now, that\\'s the mindset that I\\'m in.  And you know who I\\'m blaming?  - Grandmaster, I can... - Hey!  Don\\'t interrupt me!  Here you go.  Why are you handing me the melt stick?  He was interrupting.  That\\'s not a capital violation.  Where was I?  My precious champion has come up missing...  and it\\'s all because of that Lord of Thunder.  It\\'s all because of him. Your brother.  Whatever the story is. Adopted, or complicated.  I\\'m sure there\\'s a big history.  And your contender...  LOKI: My dear friend...  if you were to give me 12 hours,  I could bring them both back to you. Alive.  I could do it in two.  I could do it in one.  Let\\'s stop there.  You know what? I woke up this morning  thinking about a public execution.  But for now, I\\'ll settle for this sweet little...  (EXCLAIMS) \"Who\\'s gonna get him first?\"  So, you\\'re on the clock.  What have you done?  I don\\'t answer to you, lackey.  It\\'s Loki.  And you will answer to the Grandmaster.  -(GRUNTS) - Hmm.  Why would you help my brother escape with that green fool?  I don\\'t help anyone.  You\\'re a Valkyrie.  I thought the Valkyrie had all died gruesome deaths.  Choose your next words wisely.  I\\'m terribly sorry. Must be a very painful memory.  (GRUNTS)  THOR: The sun\\'s going down. It\\'s getting really low.  The sun\\'s going down.  - It\\'s getting real low. - Oh, shoot.  - Sun\\'s getting low. - Would you stop saying that?  I just need you to stay calm.  Calm? I\\'m on an alien planet!  It\\'s just a planet. You\\'ve been on a planet before.  Yeah. One.  Now you\\'ve been on two. That\\'s a good thing.  It\\'s a new experience.  My neurons, they\\'re firing faster  than my brain can handle the information.  The whole thing is totally different this time.  In the past, I always felt like Hulk and I  each had a hand on the wheel.  But this time, it\\'s like he had the keys  to the car and I was locked in the trunk.  All right, well, you\\'re back now. That\\'s all that matters.  No, it\\'s not what matters.  What I\\'m trying to tell you, is that  if I turn into the Hulk again...  Banner may never come back.  And we\\'re stranded on a planet  that is designed to stress me out.  We\\'re not stranded.  I\\'m gonna figure out a way to get us home.  Thank you.  Not your home, though. Asgard. My home.  What?  Listen, my people are in great danger.  You and I, we have to fight this really powerful being...  who also happens to be my sister.  Okay, that is so wrong on so many...  I don\\'t wanna fight your sister.  That\\'s a family issue.  No, she\\'s an evil being.  I don\\'t care what she is.  I\\'m not fighting any more beings. I\\'m sick of it.  - What? - I just told you.  If I turn into the Hulk,  I am never gonna come back again.  And you don\\'t care.  No, no. I\\'m putting together the team.  The Hulk is the fire.  Wait, you\\'re just using me to get to the Hulk.  - What? No! - It\\'s gross.  You don\\'t care about me. You\\'re not my friend.  No! I don\\'t even like the Hulk.  He\\'s all like...  \"Smash, smash, smash.\"  I prefer you.  Thanks.  But if I\\'m being honest,  when it comes to fighting evil beings...  he is very powerful and useful.  Yeah, Banner\\'s powerful and useful, too.  Is he though?  How many PhDs does Hulk have? Zero.  How many PhDs does Banner have? Seven.  Fine, you don\\'t have to fight anyone.  But we\\'re in danger here, so we have to move.  What are you doing with that?  I need a disguise. I\\'m a fugitive.  - I need a disguise. - You are the disguise.  - I\\'ll be Tony Stark. - What?  Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.  No, no, you\\'re not Tony. You\\'re Bruce. Bruce Banner.  Then why did you dress me up like Tony?  Because you were naked.  Okay, I\\'ll give you that.  What are you doing? Stop doing that!  Tony wears his pants super tight  - Stop it! - I\\'m sorry.  - Why are you being so weird? - I don\\'t know.  Maybe the fact that I was trapped for two years...  inside of a monster made me a little weird.  Hey. Shh. It\\'s okay.  You\\'re good. Calm down. Come on.  Listen, we\\'re gonna go to Asgard...  and you\\'re not gonna have to think about  the Hulk ever again.  - All right? - All right.  -(PEOPLE CHEERING) -(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)  ALL: (CHANTING) Hulk!  Oh. This is bad.  Banner! Banner!  Banned  (FIREWORKS BURSTING)  Banned  Thor!  (SNARLS)  Hi.  Hi.  I was gonna do that.  Yeah, Well, I did it first.  That\\'s good. What are you doing here?  What are you doing here? I thought you were leaving.  I got sidetracked.  What\\'s with the...  It\\'s my disguise.  But I can see your face.  Not when I do this, you can\\'t.  Your hair looks nice. I like what you did with it.  Change it? Washed it maybe?  BANNER: What are those things on her eyes?  Are those the people that she\\'s killed?  She\\'s so beautiful and strong and courageous.  Who is this guy?  - He\\'s a friend. - Who? Me?  - I\\'m Bruce. - I feel like I know you.  I feel like I know you, too.  (DISTANT CHATTERING)  Look, I\\'ve spent years in a haze,  -trying to forget my past. - THOR: Mmm.  Sakaar seemed like the best place  to drink and forget, and to die one day.  I was thinking that you drink too much,  and that probably was gonna kill you.  I don\\'t plan to stop drinking.  - Oh. - But I don\\'t wanna forget.  I can\\'t turn away any more...  so if I\\'m gonna die...  well, it may as well be driving my sword  through the heart of that murderous hag.  - Good. - BANNER: Yeah.  So, I\\'m saying that I wanna be on the team.  Has it got a name?  Yeah, it\\'s called the Revengers.  Revengers?  Because I\\'m getting revenge. You\\'re getting revenge.  (STAMMERS)  Do you want revenge?  (STAMMERS) I\\'m undecided.  Okay.  Also, I\\'ve got a peace offering.  Surprise.  (CLATTERS)  Ow.  Just had to be sure.  Hello, Bruce.  So, last time I saw you,  you were trying to kill everybody.  Where are you at these days?  It varies from moment to moment.  THOR: Is that a Dragonfang?  It is.  THOR: My God.  This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.  Sakaar and Asgard are about as far apart  as any two known systems.  Our best bet is a Wormhole just outside of city limits.  Refuel on Xandar, and we can be back in Asgard  in 18 months.  Nope. We are going through the big one.  The Devil\\'s Anus?  Anus?  Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?  For the record, I didn\\'t know  it was called that when I picked it.  That looks like a collapsing neutron star...  inside of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.  We need another ship.  That would tear mine to pieces.  THOR: She\\'s right. We need one that can withstand  the geodetic strain from the singularity.  And has an offline power steering system...  that could also function without the on-board computer.  And we need one with cup holders,  because we\\'re gonna die. So, drinks!  Do I know you? I feel like I know you.  I feel like I know you, too. It\\'s weird.  THOR: What do you say?  Uncharted metagalactic travel  through a volatile cosmic gateway.  Talk about an adventure.  - We need a ship. - Need a ship.  There are one or two ships.  Absolute top of the line models...  I don\\'t mean to impose...  (GLASS SHATTERS)  But the Grandmaster has a great many ships.  I may even have stolen  the access codes to his security system.  And suddenly you\\'re overcome  with an urge to do the right thing.  Heavens, no.  I\\'ve run out of favour with the Grandmaster...  and in exchange for codes and access to a ship...  I\\'m asking for safe passage through the Anus.  You\\'re telling us that you can get us  access into the garage...  without setting off any alarms?  Yes, brother. I can.  Okay, can I just... (WHISTLES) A quick FYI.  I was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago...  and he was totally ready to kill any of us.  He did try to kill me.  Yes, me too. On many, many occasions.  There was one time when we were children...  he transformed himself into a snake,  and he knows that I love snakes.  So, I went to pick up the snake to admire it...  and he transformed back into himself  and he was like, \"Yeah, it\\'s me!\"  And he stabbed me. We were eight at the time.  VALKYRIE: If we\\'re boosting a ship...  we\\'re gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace.  Why not set the beast loose?  Shut up.  You guys have a beast?  No, there\\'s no beast. He\\'s just being stupid.  We\\'re going to start a revolution.  - Revolution? - I\\'ll explain later.  - Who\\'s this guy again? - I\\'ll explain later.  Is that some sort of protoplasm,  all the stuff that\\'s coming out of you...  or are they 999$?  Looks like eggs.  - Oh! -(CLATTERING)  I\\'m looking for Korg.  Who\\'s asking?  I know you\\'re asking.  Is anyone else asking, or is it just you?  The Lord of Thunder sends his best.  (GUN POWERING UP)  The revolution has begun.  Revolution? How did this happen?  Don\\'t know.  But the arena\\'s mainframe  for the Obedience Disks have been deactivated...  and the slaves have armed themselves.  Oh. I don\\'t like that word.  Which? Mainframe?  No. Why would I not like \"mainframe\"?  No, the \"S\" word.  Sorry, the prisoners with jobs have armed themselves.  Okay, that\\'s better.  (BEEPING)  Hey, so, listen. We should talk.  I disagree.  Open communication was never our family\\'s forte.  You have no idea.  Been quite the revelation since we last spoke.  Hello.  Hi.  Odin brought us together.  It\\'s almost poetic that his death should split us apart.  We might as well be strangers now.  Two sons of the crown, set adrift.  - Oh. -(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)  Thought you didn\\'t wanna talk about it.  Here\\'s the thing.  I\\'m probably better off staying here on Sakaar.  That\\'s exactly what I was thinking.  Did you just agree with me?  Come on, this place is perfect for you.  It\\'s savage, chaotic, lawless...  Brother, you\\'re gonna do great here.  Do you truly think so little of me?  Loki, l thought the world of you.  I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever.  But at the end of the day, you\\'re you and I\\'m me.  I don\\'t know, maybe there\\'s still good in you.  But let\\'s be honest,  our paths diverged a long time ago.  Yeah.  It\\'s probably for the best  that we never see each other again.  That\\'s what you always wanted.  (PATS ON THE BACK)  Hey, let\\'s do \"Get Help.\"  - What? -\"Get Help.\"  No.  - Come on, you love it. - I hate it.  It\\'s great. It works every time.  - It\\'s humiliating. - Do you have a better plan?  - No. - We\\'re doing it.  We are not doing \"Get Help.\"  -(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) - Get help! Please!  My brother, he\\'s dying.  Get help! Help him!  Classic.  (GROANS) Still hate it.  - It\\'s humiliating. - Not for me, it\\'s not.  Now, which one\\'s the ship she told us to get?  The Commodore.  THOR: Right.  Though I feel it won\\'t make much of a difference.  Oh, Loki.  I know I\\'ve betrayed you many times before...  but this time it\\'s truly nothing personal.  The reward for your capture  -will set me up nicely. -(ALARM BLARING)  Never one for sentiment, were you?  Easier to let it burn.  I agree.  (GROANING)  Oh, that looks painful.  Oh, dear brother, you\\'re becoming predictable.  I trust you, you betray me.  Round and round in circles we go.  See, Loki, life is about, it\\'s about growth.  It\\'s about change.  But you seem to just wanna stay the same.  I guess what I\\'m trying to say...  is that you\\'ll always be the God of Mischief...  but you could be more.  I\\'ll just put this over here for you.  Anyway, all got places to be, so good luck.  All right, I can figure this out.  It\\'s just another spaceship.  (POWERING UP)  GRANDMASTER: (ON SPEAKERS) Loyal Sakaarians...  Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship  and my favourite champion.  Sakaarians, take to the skies. Bring him down.  Do not let him leave this planet.  - Good shot! - Thanks.  VALKYRIE: (ON RADIO) Open the doors.  Okay.  I hope that you\\'re tougher than you look.  Why?  (SCREAMING)  -(GROANING) -(LAUGHS)  Shouldn\\'t we be shooting back or something?  Yes, we should.  Where are the guns on this ship?  VALKYRIE: There aren\\'t any.  - It\\'s a leisure vessel. - BANNER: What?  Grandmaster uses it for his good times,  orgies and stuff.  Did she just say the Grandmaster  uses it for orgies?  Yeah.  Don\\'t touch anything.  (ALARM BEEPING)  No!  (LAUGHING)  - No! - No!  (YELLS)  Get inside!  In a minute.  (ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)  I should probably go and help. Here, take the wheel.  No. I don\\'t know how to fly one of these.  You\\'re a scientist. Use one of your PhDs.  None of them are for flying alien spaceships!  Okay, come on.  There\\'s gotta be a gun on this thing.  That looks like a gun.  GRANDMASTER: (SINGING) It\\'s my birthday  It\\'s my birthday  It\\'s my birthday  (FIREWORKS BURSTING)  (MUSIC CONTINUES)  Yeah!  -(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) -(GRUNTS)  Guys, we\\'re coming up on the Devil\\'s Anus!  There she is.  Our ticket out of here.  Hey, what\\'s this?  -(DEVICE POWERS DOWN) -(LOKI GROANS)  Thank you.  Hey, man. We\\'re about to jump on that ginormous spaceship.  You wanna come?  You do seem like  you\\'re in desperate need of leadership.  Why, thank you.  Here we go.  Shit.  (EXPLOSIONS)  (BANNER GRUNTS)  (STRAINING)  SKURGE: Asgardians...  some misguided soul...  has stolen the Bifrost sword.  Tell us where it is...  or there will be consequences.  Bad ones.  Well?  You.  (ALL SCREAMING)  (MAN PROTESTING)  (WOMAN BREATHING SHAKILY)  (SOBBING)  Well? Executioner?  -(ALL GASP) - MAN: Wait!  Wait!  I know where the sword is.  I never thought I\\'d be back here.  BANNER: I thought it\\'d be a lot nicer.  I mean, not that it\\'s not nice.  It\\'s just, it\\'s on fire.  Here, up here in the mountains.  Heat signatures. People clustered together.  She\\'s coming for them.  Okay, drop me off at the palace  -and I\\'ll draw her away. - And get yourself killed?  The people trapped down there are all that matters.  While I\\'m dealing with Hela, I need you two  to help get everyone off Asgard.  How the hell are we supposed to do that?  I have a man on the ground.  (LOW INDISTINCT CHATTERING)  Asgard.  She\\'s here.  Now the ship has a gun.  I\\'ll take it from here.  I found this in the armoury.  Good luck.  Your Majesty...  don\\'t die.  You know what I mean.  HEIMDALL: We must keep moving!  Go to the Bifrost!  (STAFF THUDDING)  Sister.  You\\'re still alive.  I love what you\\'ve done with the place.  Redecorating, I see.  It seems our father\\'s solution  to every problem was to cover it up.  Or to cast it out.  He told you you were worthy. He said the same thing to me.  You see?  You never knew him.  Not at his best.  Odin and I drowned entire civilisations  in blood and tears.  Where do you think all this gold came from?  And then, one day...  he decided to become a benevolent king.  To foster peace, to protect life...  to have you.  I understand why you\\'re angry.  And you are my sister, and technically  have a claim to the throne.  And believe me, I would love for someone else to rule.  But it can\\'t be you.  You\\'re just... (SIGHS) The worst.  Okay, get up.  You\\'re in my seat.  You know, Father once told me...  that a wise king never seeks out war.  But must always be ready for it.  (PEOPLE CHATTERING)  (FENRIS GROWLS)  (GROWLING)  Go back!  (ALL CLAMOURING)  (SNARLS)  HEIMDALL: Go!  To be honest, I expected more.  Heimdall!  The sword!  (CREATURES SNARLING)  Here\\'s the difference between us.  I\\'m Odin\\'s firstborn...  the rightful heir, the saviour of Asgard.  - And you\\'re nothing. -(GRUNTS)  (BOTH GRUNTING)  (GROANS)  So simple, even a blind man could see it.  (YELLS)  Oh.  Now you remind me of Dad.  (PEOPLE CLAMOURING)  (ROARING)  The stupid dog won\\'t die!  (ALL SCREAMING)  Everything\\'s gonna be all right now. I got this.  You wanted to know who I am?  What the hell are you talking about?  You\\'ll see!  (FENRIS SNIFFING)  (GROWLS)  (SNARLS)  (ALL WHIMPERING)  (ROARING)  (ROARS)  (GROANS)  You see? No one\\'s going anywhere.  I\\'ll get that sword...  even if I have to kill every single one of them to do it.  Hey, man.  I\\'m Korg. This is Miek.  We\\'re gonna jump on that spaceship  and get out of here. Wanna come?  (SHIP APPROACHING)  Your saviour is here.  (CHUCKLING)  (SCREAMS)  Did you miss me?  Everyone, on that ship now.  Welcome home. I saw you coming.  Of course you did.  (CREATURES SNARLING)  (KORG YELLING)  It\\'s a valiant effort, but you never stood a chance.  You see...  I\\'m not a queen or a monster.  I\\'m the Goddess of Death.  What were you the god of, again?  (PANTING)  Even when you had two eyes...  you\\'d see only half the picture.  She\\'s too strong. Without my hammer, I can\\'t.  Are you Thor, the God of Hammers? Hmm?  (PANTING)  That hammer was to help you control your power,  to focus it.  It was never your source of strength.  It\\'s too late. She\\'s already taken Asgard.  Asgard is not a place. Never was.  This could be Asgard.  Asgard is where our people stand.  Even now, right now, those people need your help.  I\\'m not as strong as you.  No...  you\\'re stronger.  Tell me, brother.  What were you the god of again?  (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)  -(THUNDER RUMBLING) -(THOR YELLING)  (IMMIGRANT SONG BY LED ZEPPELIN PLAYING)  (FIREWORKS BURSTING)  (GROWLS)  (ROARS)  (YELLING)  - You\\'re late. - You\\'re missing an eye.  VALKYRIE: This isn\\'t over.  (ALL PANTING)  I think we should disband the Revengers.  Hit her with a lightning blast.  I just hit her with the biggest lightning blast  in the history of lightning.  It did nothing.  We just need to hold her off until everyone\\'s on board.  It won\\'t end there.  The longer Hela\\'s on Asgard, the more powerful she grows.  She\\'ll hunt us down.  We need to stop her here and now.  So what do we do?  I\\'m not doing \"Get Help.\"  Asgard\\'s not a place, it\\'s a people.  Loki...  this was never about stopping Ragnarok.  This was about causing Ragnarok.  Surtur\\'s crown, the vault.  It\\'s the only way.  Bold move, brother.  Even for me.  Shall we?  After you.  (GRUNTING)  (GRUNTING)  This is madness.  (ALL CLAMOURING)  Go! Go, now!  (CREATURES SNARLING)  (PEOPLE CLAMOURING)  (MAN SCREAMS)  (GUN FIRING)  For Asgard.  SKURGE: Hela!  (GUN CLICKS)  (GRUNTS)  (YELLS)  (GROANS)  With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.  (GASPING)  Hela, enough!  You want Asgard, it\\'s yours.  Whatever game you\\'re playing, it won\\'t work.  You can\\'t defeat me.  No, I know.  But he can.  (ROARING)  No.  (HELA GRUNTS)  Tremble before me, Asgard!  I am your reckoning!  The people are safe.  That\\'s all that matters.  THOR: We\\'re fulfilling the prophecy.  I hate this prophecy.  So do I, but we have no choice.  Surtur destroys Asgard...  he destroys Hela, so that our people may live.  But we need to let him finish the job,  -otherwise... -(HULK ROARING)  No!  (HULK ROARING)  Hulk, stop, you moron!  (HULK GRUNTING)  (ROARS)  (SCREAMING)  THOR: Hulk, stop.  Just for once in your life, don\\'t smash.  Big monster!  Let\\'s go)!  (GROWLS)  Fine.  (HULK GRUNTS)  (GRUNTS)  SURTUR: I am Asgard\\'s doom!  (LAUGHING)  The damage is not too bad.  As long as the foundations are still strong...  we can rebuild this place.  It will become a haven...  for all peoples and aliens of the universe.  Now those foundations are gone. Sorry.  (DISTANT EXPLOSIONS)  What have I done?  You saved us from extinction.  Asgard is not a place...  it\\'s a people.  It suits you.  Maybe you\\'re not so bad after all, brother.  Maybe not.  Thank you.  If you were here, I might even give you a hug.  I\\'m here.  Your throne.  So. King of Asgard.  Where to?  I\\'m not sure.  AW Suggestions?  Miek, where are you from?  Oh, Miek\\'s dead.  Yeah, no, I accidentally stomped on him on the bridge.  I\\'ve just felt so guilty,  I\\'ve been carrying him around all day.  -(CHITTERING) -(GASPS) Miek, you\\'re alive!  He\\'s alive, guys.  What was your question again, bro?  Earth it is.  (MUSIC PLAYING)  Do you really think it\\'s a good idea  to go back to Earth?  Yes, of course.  The people of Earth love me. I\\'m very popular.  Let me rephrase that.  Do you really think it\\'s a good idea  to bring me back to Earth?  Probably not, to be honest.  I wouldn\\'t worry, brother.  I feel like everything\\'s gonna work out fine.  (LOW RUMBLING)  (MUSIC PLAYING)  (GROANING)  Oh, boy.  (SCRAPPERS EXCLAIMING)  (GROANS) on.  I just gotta say, I\\'m proud of you all.  This revolution has been a huge success. Yay, us!  Pat on the back. Pat on the back.  Come on. No?  Me too. \\'Cause I\\'ve been a big part of it.  Can\\'t have a revolution without somebody to overthrow.  So, you\\'re welcome.

       " 'Black Panther': ['BOY: Baba... MAN: Yes, my son. BOY: Tell me a story. MAN: (CHUCKLES) Which one? The story of home. Millions of years ago... a meteorite made of vibranium... the strongest substance in the universe... struck the continent of Africa... affecting the plant life around it. And when the time of man came... five tribes settled on it and called it Wakanda. The tribes lived in constant war with each other... until a warrior shaman... received a vision from the Panther Goddess Bast... who led him to the Heart-Shaped Herb... a plant that granted him superhuman strength, speed and instincts. The warrior became king... and the first Black Panther... the protector of Wakanda. Four tribes agreed to live under the king\\'s rule... but the Jabari Tribe isolated themselves in the mountains. The Wakandans used vibranium to develop technology... more advanced than any other nation. But as Wakanda thrived... the world around it descended further into chaos. To keep vibranium safe... the Wakandans vowed to hide in plain sight... keeping the truth of their power from the outside world. And we still hide, Baba? Yes. BOY: Why? (IN THE TRUNK BY TOO $HORT PLAYING) - Lucky shot! - That ain\\'t lucky! Whatever! Get outta here! Check up. Pick your man up! He open. Where you at? Let\\'s go, let\\'s go, let\\'s go. Pass! Pass! - Got you, E. - E, hurry up! Watch me get this. Tim Hardaway style. That\\'s what I call it, baby. KID: Come on. BOY: What you got? You ain\\'t got nothing. MAN: Hey, look, if we get in and out quick, won\\'t be no worries. You in the van, come in through from the west. Come around the corner. - Land right here. - Mmm-hmm. Me and the twins are pulling up right here. We\\'re leaving this car behind, okay? We come this... (FAINT RUSTLING) Hide the straps. Yo, is it the Feds? No. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) It\\'s these two Grace Jones-looking chicks. They\\'re holding spears. Open it. JAMES: You serious? They won\\'t knock again. (SPEAKING XHOSA) Who are you? Prince N\\'Jobu, son of Azzuri. (SPEAKING XHOSA) Prove to me you are one of us. (SPEAKS XHOSA) My King. This is James. I trust him with my life. He stays... with your permission, King T\\'Chaka. As you wish. At ease. (SPEAKS XHOSA) Come, baby brother. how you are holding up. You look strong. Glory to Bast, I am in good health. How is home? Not so good. (IN XHOSA) Baby brother. There has been an attack. This man... Ulysses Klaue... stole a quarter ton of vibranium from us... and triggered a bomb at the border to escape. Many lives were lost. He knew where we hid the vibranium... and how to strike. He had someone on the inside. Why are you here? Because I want you to look me in the eyes... and tell me why you betrayed Wakanda. I did no such thing. (SPEAKS XHOSA) Tell him who you are. Zuri, son of Badu... What? James. James, you lied to me? Leave him. You were Wakandan this whole time? You betrayed Wakanda! How could you lie to me like... Stand down. Did you think that you were the only spy we sent here? Prince N\\'Jobu... you will return home at once... where you will face the Council... and inform them of your crimes. Check up! (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Guard your man, guard your man! Yo. REPORTER: The tiny nation of Wakanda is mourning the death of its monarch, King T\\'Chaka. The beloved ruler was one of many confirmed dead... after a terrorist attack at the United Nations a week ago. The suspect has since been apprehended. Though it remains one of the poorest countries   in the world... fortified by mountain ranges... and an impenetrable rainforest... Wakanda does not engage in international trade or accept aid. The succession of the throne... is expected to fall to the oldest of the king\\'s two children... Prince T\\'Challa. OKOYE: My Prince... coming up on them now. No need, Okoye. I can handle this alone. Hmm. I will get Nakia out as quickly as possible. Just don\\'t freeze when you see her. What are you talking about? I never freeze. (MEN GRUNTING) MILITANT 1: What\\'s going on? MILITANT 2: It\\'s the car. It lost power. It won\\'t start. The car no start. MILITANT 3: What happened? MILITANT 4: The engine failed. MILITANT 1: Ours, too. What is it, Captain? - Defense positions. - (GUNS COCKING) Defense positions. MILITANT 2: Are we under attack? Defense positions. Get around to the side. Defense positions. Hey. Defense positions! No games. (BARKING) What do you see? (WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY) - Come in. Come in. - (SCREAMS) Over there! Look back! Watch out! (ALL SCREAMING AND GRUNTING) NAKIA: T\\'Challa, no! This one\\'s just a boy. He got kidnapped as well. BLACK PANTHER: Nakia... I... - I wanted... - MILITANT 1: Hey! I have her! Don\\'t move! I will shoot! I will shoot her right now. (GROANS) You froze. BLACK PANTHER: Ah... Why are you here? You\\'ve ruined my mission. My father is dead, Nakia. I will be crowned king tomorrow. And I wish for you to be there. NAKIA: Carry yourselves home now. WOMAN: Thank you. And take the boy. Get him to his people. Thank you oh. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) You will speak nothing of this day. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. (WAKANDA BY BAABA MAAL PLAYING) OKOYE: Sister Nakia... My Prince... we are home. This never gets old. (WAKANDA BY BAABA MAAL  PLAYING) Queen Mother... Princess... My comfort for your loss. RAMONDA: Thank you, Nakia. It is so good to have you back with us. Take her to the River Province to prepare her for the ceremony. Yes, General. Did he freeze? Like an antelope in headlights. (LAUGHING) Are you finished? So surprised my little sister came to see me off before our big day. You wish! I\\'m here for the EMP beads. I\\'ve developed an update. Update? No. It worked perfectly. How many times do I have to teach you? Just because something works doesn\\'t mean that it cannot be improved. You are teaching me? What do you know? SHURI: More than you. I can\\'t wait to see what kind of update you make... to your ceremonial outfit. Shuri! Sorry, Mother! How are you feeling today, Mama? Proud. Your father and I would talk about this day all the time. He is with us... and it is your time to be king. Good morning. How can I help you? I was just checking out these artifacts. They tell me you\\'re the expert. Ah. You could say that. They\\'re beautiful. Where\\'s this one from? The Bobo Ashanti tribe... present day Ghana... 19th century. For real? What about this one? That one\\'s from the Edo people of Benin... 16th century. Now, tell me about this one. Also from Benin, seventh century. (CLEARS THROAT) Fula tribe, I believe. Nah. I beg your pardon? It was taken by British soldiers in Benin but it\\'s from Wakanda. And it\\'s made out of vibranium. (CHUCKLES) Don\\'t trip. I\\'mma take it off your hands for you. These items aren\\'t for sale. How do you think your ancestors got these? You think they paid a fair price? Or did they take it, like they took everything else? Sir, I\\'m going to have to (CLEARS THROAT) ask you to leave. You got  all this security in here watching me ever since I walked in. - (CLEARS THROAT) - But you ain\\'t checking for - what you put in your body. - (GASPS) All right, mate. Let\\'s have it. - Come on, mate. Time. - (GRUNTS) I think she might not be feeling too good. Somebody get some help! Come here! Call a doctor, please! Please, somebody, come help! GUARD: Medical emergency right away in the West African Exhibit, please, right away. Look out. Step back, please. Step back. Thank you. Coming through over there. Medics coming through. I\\'m gonna take a break. MEDIC 1: Let\\'s give the lady some space, please. MEDIC 2: Step back, please, gents. Step back, please. (GUARDS GRUNT) Hey, come here. Come here. It\\'s okay. You can go, but just don\\'t tell anyone, all right? Bro, why you ain\\'t just shoot him right here? Because it\\'s better to leave the crime scene more spread out. Makes us look like amateurs. (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Now then, let\\'s see if you know what you\\'re talking about. (DEVICE WHIRRING) That\\'s just a taste. (SNIFFING) - You\\'re gonna be a rich boy. - You better sell that quick. (CHUCKLES) It\\'s already sold! Whatever you try, the Wakandans\\'ll probably show up. That\\'ll make my day. I can kill two birds with one stone. You\\'re not telling me that\\'s vibranium, too? Nah, I\\'m just feeling it. (SIREN WAILING) (UPBEAT DRUMMING) (SPEAKING XHOSA) Onward! Onward!

We have watched with disgust... as your technological advancements have been overseen by a child! Who scoffs at tradition! And now you want to hand the nation over to this prince... who could not keep his own father safe. Mmm? We will not have it. I said, we will not have it, oh! I, M\\'Baku... leader of the Jabari...

Have you not prepared to be king your whole life? Have you not trained and studied, been by my side? what I am talking about. I am not ready to be without you. A man who has not prepared his children for his own death... has failed as a father. Have I ever failed you? Never. Tell me how to best protect Wakanda. I want to be a great king, Baba. Just like you. You\\'re going to struggle. So you\\'ll need to surround yourself with people you trust. You\\'re a good man with a good heart. And it\\'s hard for a good man to be king. (GASPING) Breathe. T\\'Challa, breathe. (BREATHING DEEPLY) Breathe. He was there. (CHUCKLES) He was there. My father. (BEREBERE BY IDRISSA SOUMAORO PLAYING) Just one? Come home, Nakia. I\\'m right here. Stay. I came to support you and to honor your father... but I can\\'t stay. I found my calling out there. I\\'ve seen too many in need just to turn a blind eye.  I can\\'t be happy here... knowing that there\\'s people out there who have nothing. What would you have Wakanda do about it? Share what we have. We could provide aid... and access to technology and refuge to those who need it. Other countries do it, we could do it better. We are not like these other countries, Nakia. If the world found out what we truly are... what we possess... we could lose our way of life. Wakanda is strong enough to help others and protect ourselves at the same time. (SIGHS) If you were not so stubborn, you would make a great queen. I would make a great queen because I am so stubborn. - Ah! See, you admit it! - If that\\'s what I wanted. T\\'CHALLA: Is that him? Glory to Bast, man. Is he still growing? W\\'KABI: Of course. I see Nakia is back. You guys going to work it out? T\\'Challa... what\\'s wrong? Nakia thinks we should be doing more. More, like what? Foreign aid, refugee programs. You let the refugees in... they bring their problems with them. And then Wakanda is like everywhere else. Now if you said you wanted me and my men... to go out there and clean up the world, then I\\'ll be all for it. But waging war on other countries has never been our way. (KIMOYO BEADS TRILLING) You, too, huh? Bast! We\\'re in trouble. My King. My love. You will never guess who just popped up on our radar. A misidentified Wakandan artifact... was stolen yesterday from a British museum. We have learned Ulysses Klaue... plans to sell the vibranium to an American buyer... in South Korea... tomorrow night. Klaue has escaped our pursuits for almost 30 years. Not capturing him is, perhaps, my father\\'s greatest regret. I wish to bring Klaue back here to stand trial. Wakanda does not need a warrior right now.  We need a king. My parents were killed when he attacked. Not a day goes by when I do not think about what Klaue took from us. From me. It\\'s too great an opportunity to pass. W\\'KABI: Take me with you. We\\'ll take him down together, side by side. I need you here protecting the border. Then I ask... you kill him where he stands... or you bring him back to us. You have my word. I will bring him back. We will proceed with the mission. (UPBEAT AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING) My King! - Stop it. Stop it. - (CHUCKLES) I\\'ve already sent a car ahead to Busan for you. Who are you taking with you to Korea? Okoye. And Nakia as well. You sure it\\'s a good idea to take your ex on a mission? Yes. We\\'ll be fine. Besides, you\\'ll be on call should we need backup. Yes! I have great things to show you, Brother. Here are your communication devices for Korea. Unlimited range, also equipped with audio surveillance system. Check these out. Remote access Kimoyo Beads. Updated to interface directly with my sand table. T\\'CHALLA: Ah. And what are these? The real question is (SHOUTS) what are those? (CHUCKLES) Why do you have your toes out in my lab? What, you don\\'t like my royal sandals? I wanted to go old school for my first day. I bet the Elders loved that. (CHUCKLES) Try them on. Fully automated. Like the old American movie Baba used to watch. T\\'CHALLA: Mmm. And I made them completely sound absorbent. Interesting. Guess what I call them. Sneakers. Because you... Never mind. If you\\'re going to take on Klaue... you\\'ll need the best the design group has to offer. Exhibit A. T\\'CHALLA: My design. SHURI: Old tech. - Old? - Functional, but old. \"Hey, people are shooting at me. \"Wait, let me put on my helmet.\" - Enough.  - (CHUCKLES) Now, look at these. Do you like that one? Tempting. But the idea is to not be noticed. This one. (TRILLING) Now tell it to go on. SHURI: Ooh! The entire suit sits within the teeth of the necklace. Strike it. - Anywhere? - Mmm-hmm. Not that hard, genius! You told me to strike it. You didn\\'t say how hard. I invite you to my lab, and you just kick things around? Well, maybe you should make it a little stronger. Hey. Wait a minute. SHURI: The nanites absorb the kinetic energy... and hold it in place for redistribution. Very nice. Strike it again in the same spot. (KIMOYO BEADS BEEP) You\\'re recording? For research purposes. (SHURI LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) Delete that footage. (HANGOVER BY PSY AND SNOOP DOGG PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) This way. Bast willing, this will go quickly... and I can get this ridiculous thing off my head. It looks nice. Just whip it back and forth. What? It\\'s a disgrace. (IN KOREAN) Hello Sophia. Good to see you. Who are these two? My friends from Kenya. Very deep pockets. They\\'re good. Good for trouble... ...like you? (EXCLAIMS) Thank you! (PRAY FOR ME BY THE WEEKND AND KENDRICK LAMAR PLAYING) Spread out. The buyer is likely already here. The woman outside. What trouble was she referring to? Ah... I got into a disagreement with some ivory traders. - Made a bit of a mess. - Hmm. And will there be any trouble tonight, Ms. Kenyan Heiress? Depends... on how quickly we finish the mission. OKOYE: (ON RADIO) Can we please focus? Thank you. (SPEAKING KOREAN) Over here. One whiskey, please. Eyes up. Americans. I count three. OKOYE: Five. How could you miss Greased Lightning there behind you? Six. Just spotted an old friend who works for the CIA. It just got a little more complicated.  Agent Ross. Your Highness. You are buying from Klaue. What I\\'m doing or not doing... on behalf of the U.S. government is none of your concern. Now, whatever the hell you\\'re up to... do me a favor, stay out of my way. I gave you Zemo. Didn\\'t I keep it under wraps... that the king of a third world country runs around in a bulletproof cat suit? I\\'d say we were even. You really need to leave, now. Klaue is leaving out that door with me. You\\'ve been warned. CROUPIER: Three, craps. Hey, you won! You know what? I think I\\'ll just take these... bring them over here - and hold on for safekeeping. - ROSS: Mmm-hmm. Okay, heads up. The king of Wakanda is here. He cannot leave with Klaue. All right. Vibranium from the attack on Sokovia links back to a person... that I\\'m not actually saying I\\'m here to make a deal with... but that deal will not be called off. When the dust settles, you and me can work something out. I\\'m not here to make a deal. (RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO) (DOOR BUZZING AND BEEPING) Klaue, plus eight! General. In position to secure our exit. And the vibranium? I don\\'t see it yet. OKOYE: I thought there were no weapons allowed in here. There\\'s not supposed to be. Somebody did not get the memo. Definitely armed. Well, that is quite the entourage. You got a mixtape coming out? Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, actually, there is one. I\\'ll send you the SoundCloud link, if you like. Hey, Dave, can you get the link to the tape? Please, don\\'t make me listen to your music. I just meant you got a lot of people with you. (CHUCKLES) You think they\\'re for you? Don\\'t worry. I can do a deal with you all by myself, thank you very much. OKOYE: Six more. It\\'s a setup. You got the diamonds?  Okay. That\\'s enough. - We need to move on Klaue. - T\\'CHALLA: Stand down. We can\\'t afford a shootout. Vibranium? I was going to buy a fancy suitcase... but I thought I\\'d save myself some money. It\\'s now or never. (IN XHOSA) Stand down! Hey! (SPEAKS XHOSA) (GRUNTING) (CROWD SCREAMING) Wakandans! They\\'re here! (PEOPLE SCREAMING) ROSS: Get outta here! KLAUE: Kill \\'em all! Diamonds, quick! (ALL GRUNTING) (YELLS) (SPEAKS XHOSA) Murderer!

Go, go, go, come on! - Do we just leave him? - He\\'ll catch up. (DEVICE BEEPS) Shuri! Yes! AUTOMATED VOICE: Remote driving system activated. Wait! Which side of the road is it? T\\'CHALLA: For Bast\\'s sake! - Just drive! - Okay, calm down! Whoo! Let\\'s go! Put some music on. What do you think this is, a funeral? (UPBEAT RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) Which one is he in now? Hey, split up! - They\\'re trying to lose us. - I\\'ll take the right. We\\'ll take the other two! I see a shortcut. (TIRES SCREECH) We\\'re not going to make it! BLACK PANTHER: Keep going! Whoo! Brother! (BLACK PANTHER GRUNTS) Hey, what was that? BLACK PANTHER: Don\\'t worry about it. You\\'re doing great. Guns. So primitive! It\\'s a vibranium car, you idiots! The bullets won\\'t penetrate! What are you doing? Just drive. (MEN YELL) - Whoo! - Shit! Hey, look at your suit. You\\'ve been taking bullets, charging it up with kinetic energy. BLACK PANTHER: Pull around the truck. Where\\'d he go? You show-off. There he is! Hold tight! (ENGINE REVS) All right. Let\\'s have some fun! (GRUNTING) (STRAINING) (PANTING) Hop in.  Put that spear in the trunk.

(BLACK PANTHER GRUNTING) (PEOPLE EXCLAIMING) (GROANING AND PANTING) BLACK PANTHER: Klaue! Did you think we would forget? (BLACK PANTHER GRUNTING) Look at me, murderer! Where did you get this weapon? You savages didn\\'t deserve it. - (GRUNTS) - (GROANS) Oh, mercy, King. Mercy. Every breath you take is mercy from me. (IN XHOSA) King! The world watches. Let\\'s go, huh? (CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING) Yeah. KLAUE: Hello. (GIGGLES) I can see you! I can. I can see you. (CACKLING) (AIR KISSES) (SPLUTTERING) So this is a big mess, huh? I figured we could go good cop, bad cop. I\\'ll talk to him first, then you guys go in. (SPEAKING XHOSA) We can\\'t let him talk to Klaue alone. Better to let him talk to Klaue alone for 5 minutes than to make a scene here. After your questioning, we will take him back to Wakanda with us. What? No. Look, I like you, a lot. But he\\'s in my custody now. He\\'s not going anywhere. Listen, I\\'m doing you guys a favor by letting you even be in here. (SPEAKING XHOSA) If he touches you again, I\\'m going to impale him to this desk. Does she speak English? When she wants to. Huh. I\\'m going in. When I\\'m done, you guys are up. - Agent Ross. - Yeah? I do appreciate your help in Busan. You see that? It\\'s called diplomacy. You\\'re welcome. (KLAUE SINGS WHAT IS LOVE BY DEE DEE HALLIGAN AND JUNIOR TORELLO) - Okoye. - (SCOFFS) Play nice. Americans. (KLAUE CONTINUES SINGING) (ROSS CLEARS THROAT) You know, you really shouldn\\'t trust the Wakandans. I\\'m much more your speed. I don\\'t trust anybody, not in this job. But what I am interested in  is that arm cannon out there. Where\\'d you get that? It\\'s an old mining tool that I made some adjustments to. But I can get you one, if you like. Why don\\'t you give me the name of your supplier, and I\\'ll ask them. He\\'s right outside. Why don\\'t you ask him yourself? What? T\\'Challa? You\\'re telling me that weapon on your arm is from Wakanda? Bingo. What do you actually know about Wakanda? ROSS: Um... Shepherds, textiles, cool outfits. KLAUE: (ON EARPIECE) It\\'s all a front. Explorers searched for it for centuries. El Dorado, the Golden City. They thought they could find it in South America... but it was in Africa the whole time. A technological marvel. All because it was built on a mound of the most valuable metal known to man. Isipho, they call it. The gift. Vibranium. Vibranium, yeah, strongest metal on earth. It\\'s not just a metal. They sew it into their clothes. It powers their city, their tech... their weapons. Weapons? (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Makes my arm cannon look like a leaf blower. That\\'s a nice fairy tale, but Wakanda is a third world country... and you stole all their vibranium. (LAUGHING) I stole... All of it? I took a tiny piece of it. They have a mountain full of it. They\\'ve been mining it for thousands of years... and they still haven\\'t scratched the surface. I\\'m the only outsider who\\'s seen it and got out of there alive. If you don\\'t believe me, you ask your friend what his suit is made of. What his claws are made of. (BEEPING) Your father told the UN... that Klaue stole all the vibranium you had. But now he\\'s telling me you have more. And you believe the word of an arms dealer strapped to a chair? (TRUCK BEEPING) (IN KOREAN) Where is that? Back there. How much more are you hiding?  (SPEAKING XHOSA) Something is happening out back. (YELLS) Get down! - (KLAUE YELLING) - Stand down! MAN 1: Cover! MAN 2: Grenade! I see you took your time, didn\\'t you? (LAUGHS) (OKOYE SPEAKING XHOSA) My King! My King. Nakia. He just jumped in front of me. (LABORED BREATHING AND GRUNTING) I don\\'t think he\\'ll make it here. It hit his spine. Give me a Kimoyo Bead. (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) This will stabilize him for now. (ROSS GRUNTING SOFTLY) (EXHALING DEEPLY) Give him to us. We can save him. OKOYE: Our mission was to bring back Klaue. We failed. This man is a foreign intelligence operative. How do we justify bringing him into our borders? He took a bullet for me. OKOYE: That was his choice. So now we are just supposed to let him die? Let us consider that we heal him. It is his duty to report back to his country. And as king, it is your duty to protect ours. I\\'m well aware of my duties, General. I cannot just let him die... knowing we can save him. Where exactly are we taking him? (UPBEAT AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING) Great! Another broken white boy for us to fix. This is going to be fun. He will live. - (KIMOYO BEADS TRILL) - (MUSIC STOPS) W\\'Kabi is here. What\\'s going on, brother? Where is Klaue? He\\'s not here. (SIGHS) He slipped through our hands. \"Slipped\"? For 30 years, your father was in power and did nothing. With you, I thought it\\'d be different. But it\\'s more of the same. Let\\'s get going, boss. You always sell to the CIA? I sell to the highest bidder. But don\\'t you worry. When I get back to Joburg... and I lay low for a bit, I\\'ll make sure both you guys get paid. Oh, I ain\\'t worried about the money, bro. I know you good for it. On our way back, just drop us off in Wakanda. You don\\'t want to  go there, boy. Yeah, I do. KLAUE: Drop it! Or your little Bonnie and Clyde routine ends today. Put your gun down now! I\\'m sorry. - Sorry, Erik. - It\\'s gonna be okay. (KLAUE GROANS) (GROANS) (KLAUE PANTING) You really want to go to Wakanda? They\\'re savages. This is what they do to people like us. KILLMONGER: I ain\\'t worried about no brand. Check these out. Each one is for a kill. You can scar yourself as much as you\\'d like. To them, you\\'ll just be an outsider. You\\'re crazy to think that you can walk in there. Ah, to think I saw you as some crazy American. (CHUCKLING) T\\'CHALLA: Leave us! So your mission did not go as planned. What happened to my uncle N\\'Jobu? My father told me he disappeared. There was a man today... wearing a ring identical to this one. That is not possible. He helped Klaue escape from us and he was wearing this ring! My grandfather\\'s ring! Do not tell me what is possible. Tell me the truth! Some truths... are too much to bear, T\\'Challa. That is not your choice to make. What happened to him? I promised the king to say nothing. I am your king now! Your uncle took... a War Dog assignment in America. Your father... placed me there... to observe... unbeknownst to him. Your uncle fell in love with an American woman. They had a child. The hardships he saw there... radicalized your uncle. I observed for as long as I could. Their leaders have been assassinated. Communities flooded with drugs and weapons. They are overly policed and incarcerated. All over the planet... our people suffer because they don\\'t have the tools to fight back. With vibranium weapons, they could overthrow every country... and Wakanda could rule them all the right way. He knew your father would not support this.  So, your uncle betrayed us. No! He helped Klaue steal the vibranium. No, no, no. You will return home at once... where you will face the Council... and inform them of your crimes. ZURI: He drew his weapon on me. - No! - (GRUNTING) ZURI: Your father killed his own brother... to save my life. Speak nothing of this. And the child? We left him. We had to... maintain... the lie. What is this? Just a little gift. (SPEAKING XHOSA) Who are you? (DEVICE WHIRRING) (GRUNTING) All right, where am I? Don\\'t scare me like that, colonizer! (STAMMERS) What? My name is Everett. Yes, I know. Everett Ross... former air force pilot and now CIA. Right. Okay, is this Wakanda? No, it\\'s Kansas. How long ago was Korea? SHURI: Yesterday. I don\\'t think so. Bullet wounds don\\'t just magically heal overnight. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) They do here. But not by magic, by technology. Don\\'t touch anything. My brother will return soon. ROSS: These train things... that\\'s magnetic levitation, right? Obviously. Obviously, but I\\'ve never seen it this efficient. The light panels, what are they? - Sonic stabilizers. - Sonic what? In its raw form... vibranium is too dangerous to be transported at that speed... so I developed a way to temporarily deactivate it. ROSS: There\\'s vibranium on those trains? There\\'s vibranium all around us. That\\'s how I healed you. (CHUCKLES) Where is T\\'Challa? His Kimoyo Beads have been switched off. Well, we are not joined at the hip, Okoye. A man showed up at the border who claims to have killed Klaue. What? W\\'Kabi is transporting him, as we speak, to the palace. We need to find your brother! An outsider? No, a Wakandan. He\\'s not a Wakandan. He\\'s one of ours. He killed his own brother...  and left a child behind... with nothing. What kind of king... What kind of man does that? No man is perfect. Not even your father. He didn\\'t even give him a proper burial. My uncle N\\'Jobu betrayed us, but my father... he may have created something even worse. Hey. Look at me. You can\\'t let your father\\'s mistakes define who you are. You get to decide what kind of king you are going to be. (KIMOYO BEADS TRILL) Brother, you need to get here now! ROSS: Erik Stevens. Graduated Annapolis age 19... MIT for grad school. Joined the SEALs and went straight to Afghanistan... where he wrapped up confirmed kills, like it was a video game. Started calling him Killmonger. He joined a JSOC ghost unit. Now these guys are serious. They will drop off the grid... so they can commit assassinations and take down governments. Did he reveal anything about his identity? SHURI: He has a War Dog tattoo... but we have no record of him. Is this man Wakandan or not? (SPEAKING XHOSA) Tell us what is going on. Speak. I\\'m standing in your house... serving justice to a man who stole your vibranium and murdered your people. Justice your king couldn\\'t deliver. I don\\'t care that you brought Klaue. Only reason I don\\'t kill you where you stand is because I know who you are. Now, what do you want? I want the throne. (LAUGHS AND SPEAKS XHOSA) My goodness. (TRIBES\\' ELDERS LAUGHING) Y\\'all sittin\\' up here comfortable. Must feel good. It\\'s about two billion people all over the world that looks like us. But their lives are a lot harder. Wakanda has the tools to liberate \\'em all. And what tools are those? Vibranium. Your weapons. Our weapons will not be used to wage war on the world. It is not our way to be judge, jury and executioner...  for people who are not our own. Not your own? But didn\\'t life start right here on this continent? So ain\\'t all people your people? I am not king of all people. I am king of Wakanda. And it is my responsibility to make sure our people are safe... and that vibranium does not fall into the hands of a person like you. KILLMONGER: Mmm... RAMONDA: Son. We have entertained this charlatan for too long. Reject his request. Oh, I ain\\'t requesting nothing. - Ask who I am. - You\\'re Erik Stevens. An American black operative. A mercenary nicknamed Killmonger. That\\'s who you are. That\\'s not my name, Princess. Ask me, King. No. Ask me. Take him away. (IN XHOSA) Who are you? I am N\\'Jadaka, son of Prince N\\'Jobu. Son of N\\'Jobu? with Panther claws in his chest! You ain\\'t the son of a king. You a son of a murderer. (IN XHOSA) You\\'re lying! - I\\'m afraid not, Queen Mother. RIVER TRIBE ELDER: (GASPS) What? (SPEAKING XHOSA) The descendent of N\\'Jobu. I\\'m exercising my blood right to challenge for the mantles of king... and Black Panther. Do not do this, T\\'Challa. BORDER TRIBE ELDER: As the son of Prince N\\'Jobu, he is within his rights. He has no rights here! The challenge will take weeks to prepare. Weeks? I don\\'t need weeks. The whole country ain\\'t gotta be there. I just need him. And somebody to get me outta these chains. T\\'Challa, what do you know of this? I accept your challenge. SHURI: He\\'ll never beat T\\'Challa. He should\\'ve just come to the first challenge and gotten it over with. (UPBEAT DRUMMING) ZURI: The king will now have the strength of the Black Panther stripped away. (LABORED BREATHING) Where is Agent Ross? I locked him in the office. He\\'s not going anywhere. This is your last chance. Throw down your weapons,  and we can handle this another way. I lived my entire life waitin\\' for this moment. I trained, I lied, I killed... just to get here. I killed in America, Afghanistan... Iraq. I took life from my own brothers and sisters right here on this continent. And all this death... just so I could kill you. Let the challenge begin. - (FAST-TEMPO DRUMMING) - (GRUNTING) Yield! (GROANS) (T\\'CHALLA GRUNTS) (GROANS) Snap out of it, T\\'Challa! (GRUNTING AND GROANING) (YELLS) (GASPS) (BREATHES HEAVILY) (GRUNTS) (GROANING) Come on, get up. Come here. This is for my father. ZURI: Erik! - Zuri, no. - Stop! - Zuri! - Zuri, don\\'t! I am the cause of your father\\'s death. Not him. Take me. I\\'ll take you both, Uncle James. No! No! No! Zuri, no! (GROANS) No! No! No! Zuri! Zuri! No! No! (YELLING) Is this your king? Huh? (T\\'CHALLA GRUNTING) Is this your king? The Black Panther, who\\'s supposed to lead you into the future? Come on, Brother! Is there nothing that can be done? - (T\\'CHALLA GRUNTING) - Him? He\\'s supposed to protect you? - No. - No! No! Nah. I\\'m your king. - No! No! - We have to go now! Queen Mother, let\\'s go! (RAMONDA CRYING) The Queen Mother and Shuri, they are safe? - Yes. - (SIGHS) (IN XHOSA) Thank you. to them immediately. (IN XHOSA) I cannot. Though my heart is with you. We cannot turn over our nation to a man who showed up here only hours ago. He is of royal blood. - He killed T\\'Challa! - In ritual combat. Does that really matter? You are the greatest warrior Wakanda has. Help me overthrow him before he becomes too strong. Overthrow? Nakia! I\\'m not a spy who can come and go as they so choose! I am loyal to that throne, no matter who sits upon it. What are you loyal to? I loved him.  I loved my country, too. Then you serve your country. No. I save my country. What\\'s wrong? The king is dead. Come with me, unless you want to join him. First Baba. And now my brother. (CRYING) Mama, we didn\\'t even get to bury him. (RAMONDA SIGHS) - (WHISPERS) It\\'s me. - Nakia. Who is this man? He\\'s a friend of T\\'Challa\\'s. He saved my life. Where\\'s Okoye? Okoye is not coming. She and the Dora Milaje will serve the new king. Wait here. What has happened to our Wakanda? (CHANTING SOFTLY) SHAMAN: Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb... to give you the powers of the Black Panther... and take you to the Ancestral Plane. (SOBBING QUIETLY) N\\'JOBU: What did I tell you about going into my things? Hmm? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) What did you find? Your home. I gave you a key hoping that you might see it someday. Yes. The sunsets there are the most beautiful in the world. But I fear you still may not be welcome. Why? They will say you are lost. But I\\'m right here. (SIGHS HEAVILY) No tears for me? Everybody dies. It\\'s just life around here. Well, look at what I have done. I should\\'ve taken you back long ago. Instead, we are both abandoned here. Well, maybe your home is the one that\\'s lost. That\\'s why they can\\'t find us. (GASPING) Breathe! Breathe, My King, breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. The Heart-Shaped Herb did that? This all of it? Yes. So when it comes time for another king, we will be ready. Another king? Yeah, go ahead and burn all that. My King, we cannot do that. It is our tradition... (CHOKING) When I tell you to do something, I mean that shit. (YELPS) (BOTH GASP) Burn it all! (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) You know, where I\\'m from... when black folks started revolutions, they never had the firepower...  or the resources to fight their oppressors. Where was Wakanda? Hmm? Yeah, all that ends today. We got spies embedded in every nation on Earth. Already in place. I know how colonizers think. So we\\'re gonna use their own strategy against \\'em. We\\'re gonna send vibranium weapons out to our War Dogs. They\\'ll arm oppressed people all over the world... so they can finally rise up and kill those in power. And their children. And anyone else who takes their side. It\\'s time they know the truth about us! We\\'re warriors! The world\\'s gonna start over, and this time, we\\'re on top. The sun will never set on the Wakandan empire. OKOYE: Wakanda has survived for so long... by fighting when only absolutely necessary. Wakanda survived in the past this way, yes. But the world is changing, General. Elders, it is getting smaller. The outside world is catching up... and soon it will be the conquerors or the conquered. I\\'d rather be the former. You heard your orders. Let\\'s get to it. ROSS: So where are we going again? NAKIA: We\\'re taking the Heart-Shaped Herb to Jabariland. Heart-Shaped Herb? What is that? It gives whoever takes it heightened abilities. It\\'s what made T\\'Challa so strong. Nakia. I don\\'t like this. The Herb belongs to us. We may be creating a bigger monster with M\\'Baku. Nakia, you should take it yourself. I am a spy with no army. I wouldn\\'t stand a chance. (SIGHS) We\\'ll go. Oh, boy. (SHUSHES) (MEN CHANTING AND GRUNTING) ROSS: Oh, shit. Look down. Stay calm. Shuri. Look down. My son... was murdered in ritual combat. - Were the odds fair? - Yes, but... So it was less a murder than a defeat. - Do not rub our noses in it! - Silence! I make the pronouncements here, girl. Look, uh, Your Highness,  the new king is a U.S... (GRUNTS) - The new king... - (MEN GRUNTING) M\\'BAKU: You cannot talk! One more word, and I will feed you to my children. I\\'m kidding. We are vegetarians. (LAUGHING) NAKIA: Great Gorilla M\\'Baku... this is why we are here. To offer this to you. An outsider sits on our throne. Only you can help us stop him. Come with me. - (GASPS) - Impossible! (RAMONDA GASPING) Is he breathing? He\\'s in a coma. Barely clinging to life. One of our fishermen found him at the edge of the river border. He brought him to me. Why do you have him in the snow? It is the only thing keeping him from joining the ancestors. We need to get him to my lab. I can heal him there. Take him. He\\'ll be dead in seconds. Nakia, the Herb. I call upon the ancestors. I call upon Bast. I am here with my son, T\\'Challa. Heal him. We must bury him. Cover him. Cover him! Okay. (IN XHOSA) Praise the ancestors. Praise the ancestors. Praise the ancestors. Praise the ancestors. Wake up, T\\'Challa. Wake up. (T\\'CHAKA SPEAKS XHOSA) My son. for you to come home... and be reunited with me. (SPEAKS XHOSA) Why? bring the boy home? Why, Baba? He... He was the truth I chose to omit. You were wrong to abandon him. I chose my people. I chose Wakanda. Our future depended... You were wrong! All of you were wrong! To turn your backs on the rest of the world! We let the fear of our discovery stop us from doing what is right! No more! I cannot stay here with you. I cannot rest while he sits on the throne. He is a monster of our own making. I must take the mantle back. I must! I must right these wrongs. - (T\\'CHALLA GASPS) - (RAMONDA EXCLAIMING) (SHIVERING) Do you have a blanket? NAKIA: Killmonger has the full support of our military.  And he burned the garden of the Heart-Shaped Herb. ROSS: Of course he did. That\\'s what he was trained to do. His unit used to work with the CIA to destabilize foreign countries. They would always strike at transitions of power... like an election year, or the death of a monarch. You get control of government, the military... - Our resources. - ROSS: Right. The Great Mound. Our vibranium, all of my designs. He will send our weapons all over the world. You must get them out of Wakanda safely. - What? - What about you? The challenge will have to continue. T\\'Challa, we will not leave Wakanda. It is my duty to keep you safe. If he gets control of our technology, nowhere will be safe. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) The Black Panther lives. And when he fights for the fate of Wakanda... I will be right there beside him. As will I. ROSS: I\\'m in, too. What? You\\'re gonna need all the help you can get. (M\\'BAKU YAWNS LOUDLY) Are you done? (STAMMERS) Are you done? Could you give me and Lord M\\'Baku a moment? (SIGHS) Thank you. I owed you a great debt. A life for a life. Consider it paid. Please allow my mother to stay here. No harm will come to her. I give you my word. You know, I could use an army as well. I bet you could. (LAUGHS) But no. I will give no Jabari lives towards your cause. It is our cause. - It is for all of us. - Oh, us? Us? You are the first king to come here in centuries... and now you speak of \"us\"? I cannot speak for past kings. But an enemy sits on the throne right now. We both know the power of vibranium. If Killmonger gains control of it, who do you think he will come for next? We will not help you. (SIGHS) (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) W\\'KABI: Everything is on schedule. Have the spies been alerted?  Yes. Some resistance to our new mission. But the War Dogs in London, New York and Hong Kong are standing by. We\\'ll strike there first. The others\\'ll come around. Look at this. A handheld sonic cannon, powerful enough to stop a tank... untraceable by metal detectors. And we got thousands of them. The world\\'s gonna find out exactly who we are. (EXPLOSION) He lives. N\\'Jadaka! Wassup? I never yielded! And as you can see, I am not dead! All that challenge shit is over with! I\\'m the king now! Get those planes in the air! Carry out the mission! - Shuri, now. - SHURI: (ON RADIO) Copy that. SHURI: Go, go, go! Come on, Ross! W\\'Kabi, man, kill this clown. W\\'Kabi, the challenge is not complete. What will we do? Border Tribe! (ALL GRUNTING) (SHOUTS IN XHOSA) (ALL YELLING) Your heart is so full of hatred... you are not fit to be a king! Come on! Ayo, the king! (SHOUTS IN XHOSA) (ALL GRUNTING) (SHOUTS IN XHOSA) Shields! (GRUNTING) (ALL YELLING) Ah! W\\'Kabi, stop this! Stop this now! No! (BLOWING HORN) (MEN CHANTING) (ALL GRUNTING) Nakia and I will get control of the Royal Talon with this. So what do I do? You\\'ll have to fly it. - What? - You were a great pilot. Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll guide you through it. It\\'s just like riding a hoverbike. What? You guys have hoverbikes? Hey, Nakia, take that. - I\\'m not a Dora. - Just put it on, it\\'s armor! Come! Good luck, Agent Ross! Yeah, I don\\'t know what I\\'m doing with this. NAKIA: We\\'re counting on you. (ALL GRUNTING) (SPEAKS XHOSA) (ALL GRUNT) (KILLMONGER GRUNTS) (SCREAMING) Come on! (ALL YELLING AND GRUNTING) NAKIA: Go, go! AUTOMATED VOICE: Remote piloting system activated. My God. SHURI: I made it American style for you. Get in. All right. (GRUNTS)  Yes! Go! We can\\'t let those weapons get beyond Wakanda. All right, I\\'m on it. (BLACK PANTHER GRUNTING) (SPEAKS XHOSA) Lock! (KILLMONGER GROANING) Get him down! Get the necklace! Get the necklace! (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) Okay, Shuri. I got \\'em. What do I do? Shoot them down, genius! All right. Here goes nothing. All right, got them. Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (YELLING) - KILLMONGER: Nice! - (SCREAMS) (STRAINING) (KILLMONGER GROANING) (WEAPON POWERS DOWN) (PANTING) (ALL YELLING) (ALL GRUNTING) BLACK PANTHER: Shuri! (YELLS) What\\'s up, Princess? You\\'ll never be a true king. (BLACK PANTHER GRUNTS) Brother! (BOTH GRUNTING) (GROANS) Shuri. Brother! Turn on the train on the bottom track. SHURI: The stabilizers will deactivate your suit! You won\\'t have protection! Neither will he. Okay! (BEEPS) I don\\'t need a suit to kill you. Your reign is over! You sat up here, safe and protected. T\\'CHALLA: You want to see us become just like the people you hate so much. Divide and conquer the land as they did! Nah, I learn from my enemies. Beat them at they own game. You have become them! You will destroy the world, Wakanda included! The world took everything away from me! Everything I ever loved! But I\\'mma make sure we\\'re even. I\\'mma track down anyone who would even think about being loyal to you! And I\\'m gonna put they ass in the dirt right next to Zuri! (YELLS) - Nakia! - (NAKIA GRUNTING) - Are you all right? - I\\'m okay. You? - Yes. - Let\\'s go. Shuri, I\\'ve lost one of them, but two are on my tail. (MUFFLED EXPLOSION) Shit. What the hell was that? AUTOMATED VOICE: The lab is under attack. What? Where? Deactivating hologram. SHURI: Ross, you have to get out of there, now! How long have I got?  AUTOMATED VOICE: Glass integrity is at 50%. Put me back in. SHURI: Ross! Ross! (ALL GRUNTING) Surrender now! You have three seconds to lay down your weapon! One! Two! (MEN GRUNTING) Witness the might of the Jabari firsthand! (YELLING) (YELLS) (SHOUTS IN XHOSA) (SHOUTS IN XHOSA) (BOTH GRUNTING) (GROANING) (BOTH GRUNTING) AUTOMATED VOICE: Glass integrity is at 15%. - Critical weapons failure. - Shit! Hey, Shuri! The last cargo ship is almost at the border... but they got me trapped with some kind of cables. Make an X with your arms! AUTOMATED VOICE: Sonic Overload initiated. Now break it! AUTOMATED VOICE: System rebooting in five... four, three... two, one. System rebooted. Yes! We did it! SHURI: Great! Now get out of there! (ALL GRUNTING) (SPEAKS XHOSA) Charge! (GRUNTS) (YELLS) (W\\'KABI GRUNTS) Drop your weapon! Would you kill me, my love? For Wakanda? Without question! (SPIRITUAL AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING) (BOTH GRUNTING) This is it for you, Cousin. (GROANING) Hell of a move! (BREATHES HEAVILY) My pop said Wakanda was the most beautiful thing he ever seen. (KILLMONGER GROANS) He promised he was gonna show it to me one day. You believe that? Kid from Oakland, running around believing in fairy tales. (GROANING) (SIGHS) It\\'s beautiful. (LABORED BREATHING) Maybe we can still heal you. Why? So you can just lock me up? Nah. Just bury me in the ocean... with my ancestors that jumped from the ships. \\'Cause they knew death was better than bondage. (GRUNTS) (SIGHS) (WAKANDA BY BAABA MAAL PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Thank you. You saved me. You saved my family. Our nation. There\\'s nothing to thank me for. It is our duty to... It was my duty to fight for what I love. I should\\'ve...  You can\\'t blame me, I almost died. Stay. I think I know a way you can still fulfill your calling. Please stay. (SLEEP WALKIN BY MOZZY PLAYING) KID 1: Oh, he moves it! He moves it! KID 2: Who man is that? KID 3: Bucket! KID 2: Easy. When you said you would take me to California for the first time... I thought you meant Coachella... or Disneyland. Why here? This is where our father killed our uncle. They\\'re tearing it down. Good. They are not tearing it down. I bought this building. And that building. And that one over there. This will be the first Wakandan International Outreach Center. Nakia will oversee the social outreach. And you will spearhead the science and information exchange. (CHUCKLES) You\\'re kidding. Eh? (KIMOYO BEADS TRILL) Oh... Hey, yo. Man, what the hell is that? KID 2: That\\'s like a Bugatti spaceship! Bro, it came out of nowhere. Did y\\'all see that? What? KID 2: Check it out, bro. We can take this back to the house. Pull up to school in this. Look, we can break it apart. We can sell it. KID 4: On eBay. KID 2: Everybody get, like, a million apiece. SHURI: I wouldn\\'t do that if I were you guys. KID 2: Where you come from? SHURI: From Wakanda. KID 4: What is a Wakanda? KID 5: Hey, yo! This yours? Who... Who are you? (ALL THE STARS BY KENDRICK LAMAR AND SZA PLAYING) (CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING) My name is King T\\'Challa... son of King T\\'Chaka. I am the sovereign ruler of the nation of Wakanda. And for the first time in our history... we will be sharing our knowledge and resources... with the outside world. Wakanda will no longer watch from the shadows. We cannot. We must not. We will work to be an example of how we... as brothers and sisters on this earth... should treat each other.  Now, more than ever... the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth. More connects us than separates us. But in times of crisis... the wise build bridges... while the foolish build barriers. We must find a way... to look after one another... as if we were one, single tribe. With all due respect, King T\\'Challa... what can a nation of farmers have to offer the rest of the world? (ALL MURMURING) (RUSTLES) (BOYS GIGGLING) Are you playing around with that man again? - No. - You\\'re teasing him again. - Don\\'t wake him. He must rest. - THABO: No, I\\'m not. No, I\\'m not.

       " 'Avengers Infinity War': ['This is the Asgardian refugee vessel. We are under assault. I repeat, we are under assault. Aliens are dead, sliced open... Requesting aid from any vessel within range... Our crew is made of Asgardian families, we have very few soldiers here. This is not a war craft, I repeat, this is not a war craft. Hear me... and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan. You may think this is suffering. No. It is salvation. Universal scales tipped toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile for even in death you have become Children of Thanos. I know what it\\'s like to lose. To feel so desperately that you\\'re right, yet to fail nonetheless. As lightning turns the legs to jelly. I ask you to what end? Dread it, run from it... Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it\\'s here. Or should I say... I am. You talk too much. The Tesseract. Or, your brother\\'s head. I assume you have a preference? Oh, I do. Kill away. All right, stop! We don\\'t have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard. You really are the worst, brother. I assure you, brother. The sun will shine on us again. Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian. Well, for one thing, I\\'m not Asgardian. And for another... we have a Hulk. Let him have his fun. Forefathers... Let the dark magic, flow through me one last... time. That was a mistake. No! You are going to die for that! My humble personage... bows before your grandeur. No other being, has ever had the might, nay, the nobility, to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones. The Universe, lies within your grasp. There are two more Stones on Earth. Find them, my Children, and bring them to me on Titan. - Father, we will not fail you. - If I might, interject... If you\\'re going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena. If you consider failure experience. I consider experience, experience. Almighty Thanos. I, Loki, Prince of Asgard... Odin-son... The rightful king of Jotunheim, God of Mischief... Do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity. \"Undying\"? You should choose your words more carefully. You... will never be... a god. No resurrections this time. No... Loki... Seriously? You don\\'t have any money? Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual. I\\'ll tell the guys at the deli. Maybe they\\'ll make you a metaphysical Ham and Rye. - Wait, wait. I think I got a 200. - Dollars? - Rupees. - Which is? I wouldn\\'t say no to a Tuna Melt. Thanos is coming. We\\'ve got to... Who? Slow down. I\\'m totally not kidding. - No, I\\'m not. - Your rambling lost me. Look, you know how you\\'re having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee? Yeah. Okay, then you\\'re like, my God, there\\'s no bathroom, what am I gonna do? Oh! Someone\\'s watching! Right. And then you wake up, and in real life you actually have to pee. - Yes. - Yeah. Everybody has that. Right. That\\'s the point I\\'m trying to make. Last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. - What was his name? Porsey. Morgan. - Right. So you woke up, and we were... - Expecting. - Yeah. - Yes? - No. - I had a dream about it. It was so real. - If you wanted to have a kid... You wouldn\\'t have done that. I\\'m glad you brought this up cause it\\'s nothing, just a housing unit for nano-parts. - It\\'s not helping your case. OK? - It\\'s an attachment. It\\'s not a... - You don\\'t need that. - I know. I had the surgery. I\\'m just trying to protect us. The future, as is, and that\\'s it.   Just in case there\\'s a monster in the closet. Just letting you know. Shirts. You know me so well. You finish all my sentences. You should have shirts in your closet. Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We\\'ll have a nice dinner tonight. We should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you. - Yeah. - I will. Tony Stark, I\\'m Dr. Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh. Congratulations on the wedding, by the way. I\\'m sorry. You giving out tickets or something? We need your help. Look, it\\'s not overselling it to say that the fate of the Universe is at stake. And who\\'s \"we\"? - Hey, Tony. - Bruce! You okay? From the dawn of the Universe, there was nothing. Then, boom! The Big Bang sends six elemental crystals, hurdling across the virgin Universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence. Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time. - Tell me his name again. - Thanos. He\\'s a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He sent Loki. The attack on New York. That\\'s him. - What\\'s our time line? - No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that only makes him the strongest creature in the whole Universe. If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony... He can destroy life on a scale of hitherto hundredth of. Did you seriously just say \"hitherto hundredth of\"? Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos? Is that what that is? I\\'m going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don\\'t we just stick this one down the garbage disposal? No can do. We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone with our lives. And I swore off dairy, but Ben & Jerry\\'s named a flavor after me, so... - Stark Raving Hazelnuts.  - It\\'s not bad. A bit chalky. \"A Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge\" is our favorite. - That\\'s a thing? - Whatever. Point is, things change. Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos. And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us! Only if we don\\'t do our jobs. What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals? Protecting your reality, douche bag. Okay guys, can we quick cable this discussion right now? The fact is we have the stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone. And we have to find him now. - Yeah, that\\'s the thing. - What do you mean? Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He\\'s offline. What? - Tony, you lost another super bot? - I didn\\'t lose him. He\\'s more than that. - He\\'s evolving. - Who could find Vision, then? - Probably Steve Rogers. - Oh, great. Maybe. But... Call him. It\\'s not that easy. God, we haven\\'t caught up in a spell, have we? The Avengers broke up. We\\'re toast. Broke up? - Like a band? Like The Beatles? - Cap and I fell out hard. We\\'re not on speaking terms. Tony, listen to me. Thor\\'s gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn\\'t matter who you\\'re talking to or not. Say, Doc, you wouldn\\'t happen to be moving your hair, would you? Not at the moment, no. You okay? - Help him. Wong, Doc. - Got it. - Friday, what am I looking at? - Not sure. I\\'m working on it. You better not put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc! I might wanna use it. Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction. Holy shit! We\\'re all gonna die! There\\'s a spaceship! What\\'s the matter with you kids? You never seen a spaceship before? Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders.  Will do. Hear me, and rejoice! You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to... I\\'m sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here. Stone keeper... Does this chattering animal speak for you? Certainly not. I speak for myself. There\\'s no trespassing in this city and on this planet. - You need to get lost, Squidward! - They exhaust me. Bring me the Stone. Hey, do you want a piece? No, not really. But when do I ever get what I want. Been a while. Good to have you, buddy. I just... I need to concentrate for a second. Come on, come on, Max. Where\\'s your guy? I don\\'t know. We\\'re certainly having a thing. There\\'s no time for a thing. That\\'s the thing right there. Let\\'s go. Dude, you\\'re embarrassing me in front of the wizards. - I can\\'t... He won\\'t... - It\\'s okay. Stand down. - Can I leave you with him? Thank you. - I have him. - Where\\'d that come from? - It\\'s nano-tech. You like it? A little... Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won\\'t be joining us... - You gotta get that stone outta here, now. - It stays with me. Exactly. Bye! Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good, bad? Really good. Do you plan on helping out? I\\'m trying. He won\\'t come out. Come on, Hulk. What are you doing? Come on. Come on! Come on! No! What do you mean, \"no\"? - Hey, man! What\\'s up, Mr. Stark? - Kid, where\\'d you come from? The field trip. What is this guy\\'s problem, Mr. Stark? He\\'s from space, came here to steal a necklace from a wizard. Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children. It\\'s a simple spell but quite unbreakable. Then I\\'ll take it off your corpse. You wouldn\\'t. Removing a dead man\\'s spell... Troublesome.  You\\'ll only wish you were dead. No! - Kid, that\\'s the wizard. Get on it. - On it! Not cool. - Mr. Stark? I\\'m being beamed up. - Hang on, kid. Wong, you\\'re invited to my wedding. Give me a little juice, Friday. Unlock 17-A. Kid, you gotta let go. I\\'m gonna catch you. But you said save the wizard! I can\\'t breathe! You\\'re too high up. You\\'re running out of air. That makes sense. Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here. - Happy trails, kid. Friday, send him home. - Yup. Oh, come on! Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts. Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What\\'s going on? Yeah, I\\'m fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res. Why? Just \\'cause I\\'ll probably not make it back for awhile. - Tell me you\\'re not on that ship. - Yeah. God, no. Please tell me you\\'re not on that ship. Honey, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry. I don\\'t know how to say this. Pep... Come back here, Tony. I swear to God... Come back here right now! Come back! Boss, we\\'re losing her. I\\'m going, too... Oh, my God. I should have stayed on the bus. - Where you going? - Time Stone\\'s been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do? I\\'m gonna make a call. Sing it, Drax! Why are we doing this again? It\\'s a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying. - I get that, but why are we doing it? - \\'Cause we\\'re nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese for our help... - Which isn\\'t the point. - Which isn\\'t the point... I mean... - If he doesn\\'t pony up... - We\\'ll take his ship. - Exactly! Alright! - B-b-b-bingo! We are arriving. All right, Guardians. Don\\'t forget, this might be dangerous, so let\\'s put on our mean faces. Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don\\'t wanna tell you again. Groot.  I am Groot! - Whoa! Language! - Wow! You got some acorns on you, kid. Ever since you got little sap, you\\'re a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I\\'m gonna smash that thing to pieces! What happened? Oh, my God. Looks like we\\'re not getting paid. Wipers! Wipers! Get it off. How the hell is this dude still alive? He is not a dude. You\\'re a dude. This... This is a man. - Handsome, muscular man. - I\\'m muscular. Who are you kidding, Quill? You\\'re one sandwich away from fat. - Yeah, right. What? - It\\'s true. You have little weight... Gamora, do you think I\\'m... He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt. It\\'s like a pirate had a baby with an angel. Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I\\'m gonna get a Bowflex. I\\'m gonna commit. I\\'m gonna get some dumbbells. You know you can\\'t eat dumbbells, right? It\\'s like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fiber. Stop massaging his muscles. Wake him up. Wake. Who the hell are you guys? The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal: To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre. - Including my own. - If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this. You seem to know a great deal about Thanos. Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos. - Your father killed my brother. - Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do. Thanos can be tough. Look. Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister... that he imprisoned in Hell. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It\\'s life, there was nothing else. - And I feel your pain. - I feel your pain, as well. I mean it\\'s not a competition,  but I\\'ve been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out with both of my eyes. I need a hammer, not a spoon... How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe... - Maybe a birth date or something... - What are you doing? Taking your pod. No, you\\'re not! You\\'ll not, be taking our pod today, sir. Quill. Are you making your voice deeper? - No. - You are. You\\'re imitating the god-man. It\\'s weird. - No I\\'m not. - He just did it again! This is my voice! - Are you mocking me? - Are you mocking me? You just did it again. He\\'s trying to copy me. Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he\\'s going next. Nowhere. - He must be going somewhere. - No. Nowhere? It\\'s a place. We\\'ve been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that\\'s our food. - Not anymore. - Thor... Why would he go to nowhere? Because for years, reality stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the collector. If it\\'s with the Collector, then it\\'s not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone. Or a genius. How do you know he\\'s not going for one of the other stones? There\\'s six stones out there. Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me. When he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They\\'re with the Avengers. - The Avengers? - They\\'re Earth\\'s Mightiest Heroes. - Like Kevin Bacon? - He may be on the team. I don\\'t know. Haven\\'t been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, no one\\'s ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can\\'t get it.  Therefore, he\\'s going to Nowhere. Hence, he\\'ll be getting the Reality Stone. You\\'re welcome. - Then we have to go to Nowhere now. - Wrong. - Where we have to go, is Nivadellir. - That\\'s a made up word. - Oh what\\'s made up? - Nidavellir is real? Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend. They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please. The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest one. Rabbit? Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need. - I assume you\\'re the captain, sir? - You\\'re very perceptive. You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nivadellir? Lemme just ask the captain. Wait a second, it\\'s me! Yeah, I\\'ll go. - Wonderful. - Except that I\\'m the captain. - Quiet! - And that\\'s my backpack. - Quill, sit down. - Look, this is my ship. And I\\'m not going to... Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here? The Thanos killing kind. Don\\'t you think that we should all have a weapon like that? No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as you minds collapse to the madness. Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now? A little bit. Yeah. If we don\\'t go to Nowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, - he\\'ll be too powerful to stop. - He already is. I got it figured out. We got two ships, and the largest go with the morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Nowhere to try and stop Thanos. - Cool? Cool. - So cool. For the record... I know that you\\'re only going with him because it\\'s where Thanos isn\\'t. You know, you shouldn\\'t talk that way to your captain, Quill. Come on, Groot. Put that game down. You\\'ll rot your brain.  I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye. Vis? Is it the stone again? It\\'s as if it\\'s speaking to me. What does it say? I don\\'t... I don\\'t know. Something... Tell me what you feel. I just feel you. So there\\'s a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back. - What if I miss that train? - There is an 11. What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn\\'t go back? - You gave Stark your word. - I\\'d rather give it to you. There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises. Not to each other. Wanda... Two years, we\\'ve stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don\\'t know. You know what, I\\'m just gonna speak for myself. - I, I... I think... It works. - It works. It works. Stay. Or not. If I\\'m overstepping... What are they? What the stone was warning me about. - I have to go. - No. Vision. If that\\'s true... Then maybe going isn\\'t the best idea. Wanda, I... The blade. It stopped me from phasing. - Is that even possible? - It isn\\'t supposed to be. Vis! Give up the Stone, and she lives. Hands off. Come on. You gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. We have to go. - Please leave. - You asked me to stay. I\\'m staying. - Get up. - I can\\'t. We don\\'t wanna kill you. But we will. You\\'ll never get the chance again. Can you stand? Thank you, Captain. Let\\'s get you on the jet. I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don\\'t take any chances. I\\'m sorry. We just wanted time. Where to, Cap? Home. We\\'ll be safe. - Zen-Whoberians... - Mother! - Choose a side, or die. - Mother! One side, for reservation. The other, an honor... What\\'s wrong, little one? My mother. Where is my mother? What\\'s your name? Gamora.  You\\'re quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you. Look. Pretty, isn\\'t it? Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other... Here. You try. Now go in peace, and meet your maker. Concentrate. There! You\\'ve got it. Gamora. You know these grenades are the \"blow off your junk\" kind or the gas kind? \\'Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. - But I don\\'t want to... - I need to ask a favor. Yeah, sure. One way or another, the path that we\\'re on leads to Thanos. Which is what the grenades are for. I\\'m sorry. What\\'s the favor? If things go wrong... If Thanos gets me... I want you to promise me... you\\'ll kill me. What? I know something he doesn\\'t. If he finds it out... - The entire Universe could be at risk. - What do you know? If I tell you, you\\'d know, too. If it\\'s so important, shouldn\\'t I? Only if you wanna die. Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario? Just... trust me. And possibly, kill me. I mean, I\\'d like to. I really would... Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother. Okay. Dude! How long have you been standing there? - An hour. - An hour? Are you serious? I\\'ve mastered the ability, of standing so incredibly still... That I\\'ve become invisible to the eye. Watch. - You\\'re eating a zark nut. - But my movement... So slow... - And it\\'s imperceptible. - No. - I\\'m sure I\\'m invisible. - Hi, Drax. Damn it. - This place looks deserted. - I\\'m reading movement. - From the third quadrant. - Yeah. I\\'m picking that up, too. Let\\'s put it down over here. I know you have the Reality Stone. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering. I told you. I sold it. - Why would I lie? - I imagine it\\'s like breathing for you. - Like suicide.  - So you do understand. Not even you will surrender something so precious. I didn\\'t know what it was. Then you\\'re more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, Charlotte. Where\\'s the Stone? Today, he pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter. Drax, wait! Whoa, not yet! He doesn\\'t have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah. No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria. Sleep. Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I\\'m... The other right! Why? Why you? Daughter... That was quick. Magnificent! Magnificent! Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. No one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing. That is, it was. Now... Reality can be whatever I want. - You knew I\\'d come. - I counted on it. There\\'s something we need to discuss, little one. Thanos! - Let her go, Grimace! - Peter... - I told you to go right. - Now... - You let her go! - Ah, the boyfriend. I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long term booty call. - Let her go. - Peter... Or I\\'m gonna blow that nut-sack of a chin right off your face! Not him. You promised! Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him. She\\'s asked, hasn\\'t she? Do it. Do it! I told you to go right! I love you, more than anything. I love you, too. I like you. Still no word from Vision? Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh. On a stolen quinjet with four of the world\\'s most wanted criminals. You know they\\'re only criminals because you\\'ve chosen to call them that, right, sir? My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own. If it weren\\'t for those Accords, Vision would\\'ve been right here. I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel. That\\'s right.  And I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ve paid for that. - Do you have second thoughts? - Not anymore. Mr. Secretary. You got some nerve. I\\'ll give you that. You could use some of that right now. The world\\'s on fire. And you think, all is forgiven? I\\'m not looking for forgiveness. And I\\'m way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we\\'re here to fight. And if you wanna stand in our way... We\\'ll fight you, too. - Arrest them. - All over it. That\\'s a court-martial. - It\\'s great to see you, Cap. - You too, Rhodey. Hey. Well. You guys, really look like crap. Must\\'ve been a rough couple of years. Yeah, well, the hotels weren\\'t exactly five star. I think you look great. Yeah. I\\'m back. Hi, Bruce. Nat. This is awkward. We gotta assume they\\'re coming back, right? And they can clearly find us. We need all hands on deck. Where\\'s Clint? After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It\\'s too tough on their families. - Who\\'s Scott? - Ant-Man. There\\'s an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look... Thanos has the biggest army in the Universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... He gets... Vision\\'s stone. - Well then, we have to protect it. - No, we have to destroy it. I\\'ve been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps... Its molecular integrity could fail. And you, with it. We\\'re not having this conversation. Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that - Thanos can\\'t get it. - That\\'s too high a price. Only you, have the power to pay it. Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in  the way of defeating him. But it should. We don\\'t trade lives, Vision. Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different? Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. Jarvis, Ultron, Tony, me, the stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another. - You\\'re saying Vision isn\\'t just a stone? - I\\'m saying that... If we take out the stone, there\\'s still a whole lot of Vision left. - Perhaps the best parts. - Can we do that? Not me. Not here. Well you better find someone and somewhere fast. Ross isn\\'t just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back. I know somewhere. The Kingsguard and the Dora Milaje have been alerted. And the Border Tribe? - Those that are left. - Send word to the Jabari as well. M\\'Baku likes a good fight. And what of this one? This one may be tired of war. But the White Wolf has rested long enough. Where\\'s the fight? On its way. In all the time I have served Thanos... I have never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan, with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person... There would be judgment. Give me... the Stone. Wow. You are a seriously loyal piece of hardware. Speaking of loyalty... - I know what you\\'re gonna say to me. - You should not be here. - I was gonna go home. - I don\\'t wanna hear it! But it was such a long way down and I just thought about... And now I gotta hear it. And this suit is, ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So, if anything, its kind of your fault that I\\'m here. - What did you just say? - I take that back. And now I\\'m here in space. Yeah. Right where I didn\\'t want you to be. This isn\\'t Coney Island,  or some field trip. This is a one-way ticket. Do you hear me? - Don\\'t pretend you thought this through. - I did think this through. You can\\'t be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if there\\'s no neighborhood. Okay, that didn\\'t make sense but you know what I\\'m trying to say. Come on. We got a situation. See him down there? He\\'s in trouble. What\\'s your plan? Go. Okay, okay. OK, you ever see this really old movie Aliens? Painful, aren\\'t they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them... I could end your friend\\'s life in an instant. I gotta tell you, he\\'s not really my friend. Saving his life is more of a professional courtesy. You\\'ve saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine. Yeah, but the kid\\'s seen more movies. Yes! Wait, what are those? Hey, we haven\\'t officially met. Cool. - We gotta turn this ship around. - Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great, I want to protect the stone. And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I\\'m listening. For what? Nearly blasting me to space? Who just saved your magical ass? Me. I seriously don\\'t know how you fit your head into that helmet. Admit it. You should\\'ve ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you, you refused. Unlike everyone else in your life, I don\\'t work for you. And due to that fact, we\\'re now in a flying doughnut, billions of miles from Earth, - with no back-up. - I\\'m back-up! No. You\\'re a stowaway. The adults are talking. I\\'m confused as to the relationship here, I mean, what is he? Your ward? - No. I\\'m Peter, by the way. - Doctor Strange. Oh, we\\'re using our made-up names. I\\'m Spider-Man, then. The ship is self-correcting its course. Thing\\'s on autopilot. Can we control it? Fly us home? - Stark. - Yeah?  - Can you get us home? - Yeah. Heard you. I\\'m not so sure we should. Under no circumstances can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don\\'t think you quite understand what\\'s at stake here. No. It\\'s you who doesn\\'t understand that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York, and now he\\'s back! And I don\\'t know what to do. So I\\'m not so sure if it\\'s a better plan to fight him on our turf or his. But you saw. What they did, what they can do. At least, let\\'s hope he\\'s not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him, Doctor. Do you concur? All right, Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand... If it comes to saving you, the kid, or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can\\'t. Because the universe depends on it. Nice. Good. Moral compass. All right, kid... You\\'re an Avenger now. I thought you might be hungry. I always hated that chair. So I\\'ve been told. Even so, I hoped you\\'d sit in it one day. I hated this room, this ship... I hated my life. You told me that, too. Everyday. For almost twenty years. I was a child when you took me. I saved you. No. We were happy on my home planet. Going to bed hungry? Scrounging for scraps? Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I\\'m the one who stopped that. You know what\\'s happened since then? The children born, have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It\\'s a paradise. Because you murdered half the planet. A small price to pay for salvation. - You\\'re insane. - Little one, it\\'s a simple calculus. This universe is finite. Its resources, finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. - It needs correction. - You don\\'t know that! I\\'m the only one who knows that. At least, I\\'m the only one  with the will to act on it. For a time... You... had that same will, as you fought by my side, daughter. I\\'m not your daughter. Everything I hated about myself, you taught me. And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. It\\'s why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone. I\\'m sorry I disappointed you. I am disappointed. But not because you didn\\'t find it. But because you did. And you lied. Nebula! Don\\'t do this. Sometime ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me. - Please, don\\'t do this. - She very nearly succeeded. So, I brought her here... to talk. Stop. Stop it. I swear to you, on my life... I never found the Soul Stone. Accessing memory files. You know what he\\'s about to do. He\\'s finally ready, and he\\'s going for the stones. All of them. He\\'ll never get them all. He can\\'t, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone, and I burned it to ash. I burned it. You\\'re strong. Me... The generous... me... But I never taught you to lie. That\\'s why you\\'re so bad at it. Where is the Soul Stone? Vormir. The stone is on Vormir. Show me. I am Groot. Tinkle in the cup. We\\'re not looking for... What\\'s a twig? Everybody\\'s seen a twig. I am Groot! You can pour what\\'s in the cup out in space then go in the cup again. You speak Groot? Yes, the tone on Asgard, that was an elective. - I am Groot. - You\\'ll know when we\\'re close. Nivadellir\\'s forge harnesses the blazing power of the Neutron star. It\\'s the birthplace of my hammer. It\\'s truly awesome. Okay. Time to be the captain. So dead brother, huh? Yeah, that could be annoying. Well, he\\'s been dead before. Now this time, I think it really might be true. - And you said your sister and your dad... - Both dead. - But still got a mom, though?  - Killed by a Dark Elf. - A best friend? - Stabbed through the heart. You sure you\\'re up to this particular mission? Absolutely! The rage and vengeance, anger... Loss, regret, they\\'re all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind, so I\\'m good to go. Yeah, but this Thanos we\\'re talking about, he\\'s the toughest there is. - Well, he\\'s never fought me. - Yeah, he has. He\\'s never fought me twice. I\\'m getting a new hammer, don\\'t forget. It better be some hammer. You know, I\\'m 1,500 years old. I\\'ve killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one of them would\\'ve rather killed me but none succeeded. I\\'m only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is just the, latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so. And what if you\\'re wrong? Well, if I\\'m wrong, then... What more could I lose? I could lose a lot. Me personally, I could lose a lot. Okay. Well, if fate does want you to kill that crapsack, - you need more than one stupid eyeball. - What\\'s this? What\\'s it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me in Contraxia. - He gave you his eye? - No, he gave me 100 credits. I snuck into his room later that night and stole his eye. Thank you, sweet rabbit. I would\\'ve washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was on my... Hey, we\\'re here. I don\\'t think this thing works. Everything seems dark. But it ain\\'t the eye. Something\\'s wrong. The star\\'s gone out. And the rings are frozen. I hope these dwarfs are better at forging than they are at cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space. The forge hasn\\'t gone dark in centuries. - You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right? - Yes. Why? Did it look anything like that?  - I am Groot. - Get back to the pod. Eitri, wait! Stop! Thor? - What happened here? - You were supposed to protect us. - Asgard was supposed to protect us. - Asgard is destroyed. Eitri, what did you do? 300 dwarfs lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they\\'d be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. And he killed everyone anyway. All except me. \"Your life is yours,\" he said. \"But your hands. Your hands are mine alone.\" Eitri, this isn\\'t about your hands. Every weapon you\\'ve ever designed, every axe, hammer, sword, it\\'s all inside your head. Now I know it feels like all hope is lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos. Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan. - What\\'s going on? - I think we\\'re here. I don\\'t think this rig has a self-park function. Get your hand inside this. Then, we got one big dodge, so we gotta move at the same time. We might wanna turn, turn, turn. Turn! You all right? That was close. I owe you one. Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, - and I eat one of you, I\\'m sorry. - I don\\'t want another single, pop-culture reference outta you for the rest of the trip. Understand? I\\'m trying to say that, something is coming. Thanos! Oh, my God! Please don\\'t put your eggs in me! Die, Blanket of Death! Everybody stay where you are, chill the F out... I\\'m gonna ask you this one time... Where is Gamora? Yeah, I\\'ll do you one better. Who\\'s Gamora? I\\'ll do you one better! Why is Gamora? Let him go, or I swear to you, I\\'m gonna french fry this little freak. Let\\'s do it. You shoot my guy and I\\'ll blast him. Let\\'s go! - Do it, Quill. I can take it.  - No, he can\\'t take it. She\\'s right. You can\\'t. Oh yeah? You don\\'t wanna tell me where she is? That\\'s fine. I\\'ll kill all three of you and I\\'ll beat it out of Thanos myself! - Starting with you. - Wait what, Thanos? All right... Let me ask you this one time... What master do you serve? What master do I serve? Am I supposed to say Jesus? - You\\'re from Earth. - Not from Earth. I\\'m from Missouri. Yeah, that\\'s on Earth, dipshit. What are you hassling us for? - So you\\'re not with Thanos? - With Thanos? No! I\\'m here to kill Thanos. He took my girl. Wait, who are you? We\\'re the Avengers, man. - You\\'re the ones Thor told us about! - You know Thor? Yeah. Tall guy, not that good-looking. Where is he now? This the plan? We\\'ll hit him with a brick? It\\'s a mold. A king\\'s weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost. Does it have a name? Storm breaker. Yeah. It\\'s a bit much. So how do we make it? You\\'ll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of the dying star. Rabbit, fire up the pod. What the hell happened to this planet? It\\'s 8 degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place. Yeah, we got one advantage. He\\'s coming to us. We\\'ll use it. Alright, I have a plan. It\\'s pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. We definitely don\\'t want to dance with this guy, we just want the gauntlet. Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I\\'m breaking it down? Did you hear what I said? I stopped listening after you said that we need a plan. Okay, Mr. Clean\\'s on his own page. See, not winging it isn\\'t really what they do. What exactly is it that they do? Kick names, take ass. All right, just get over here, please? Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?  Star-Lord is fine. We\\'ve gotta coalesce. Because if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude... Dude, don\\'t call us plucky. We don\\'t know what it means. All right, we\\'re optimistic, yes. I like your plan, except it sucks. So let me do the plan, and that way, it might be really good. Tell him about the dance-off to save the Universe. What dance-off? - It\\'s not a, it\\'s not a... - Like in Footloose? The movie? Exactly like Footloose! Is it still the greatest movie in history? It never was. - We\\'re getting no help with Flash Gordon. - Flash Gordon? By the way? That\\'s a compliment. Don\\'t forget. I\\'m half-human. So that\\'s 50% of me that\\'s stupid, - And that\\'s 100% you. - Your math is blowing my mind. Excuse me? But does your friend often do that? Strange! You all right? - You\\'re back. You\\'re all right. - Hey, what was that? I went forward in time, to view alternate futures... To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict. - How many did you see? - 14,000,605. How many did we win? One. The Stone had better be up there. For your sister\\'s sake. Welcome, Thanos, son of Eros. Gamora, daughter of Thanos. You know us? It is my curse to know all who journey here. Where is the Soul Stone? You should know, it extracts a terrible price. I\\'m prepared. We all think that at first. We are all wrong. How is it you know this place so well? A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out. Banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess. What you seek lies in front of you. As does what you fear. - What\\'s this? - The price. Soul holds a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it is, a certain wisdom. Tell me what it needs.  To ensure whoever possesses it, understands its power... The Stone demands a sacrifice. Of what? In order to take the Stone... You must lose that which you love. A soul, for a soul. All my life, I dreamed of a day... a moment... when you got what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But, now... You kill, and torture, and you call it mercy. The Universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize and and it told you, no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one. Really? Tears? They are not for him. No. This isn\\'t love. I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even... for you. I\\'m sorry, little one. Drop to 2,600. Heading 030. I hope you\\'re right about this, or we\\'re gonna land a lot faster than you want to. When you sad we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world, this is not what I imagined. What did you imagine? The Olympics. Even a Starbucks. - Should we bow? - Yeah, he\\'s a king. Seems like I\\'m always thanking you for something. - What are you doing? - We don\\'t do that here. So how big of an assault should we expect? Sir, I think you should expect quite a big assault. - How are we looking? - You will have my Kingsguard. The Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje. And... A semi-stable 100-year old man. How have you been, Buck? Not bad, for the end of the world. The structure is polymorphic. Right. We had to attach each neuron non-sequentially. Why didn\\'t you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively? Because... we didn\\'t think of it? - I\\'m sure you did your best. - Can you do it? Yes, but there are more than 2 trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures. - It will take time, brother. - How long?  As long as you can give me. Something\\'s entered the atmosphere. Hey Cap, we got a situation here. God, I love this place. Don\\'t start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome. It\\'s too late. We need to destroy the Stone now. - Vision, get your ass back on the table. - We will hold them off. Wanda, as soon as that stone\\'s out of his head, you blow it to hell. I will. Evacuate the city, engage all defenses... and get this man a shield! I don\\'t think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving, you need something bigger to yank them loose! - Leave that to me. - Leave it to you? Buddy, you\\'re in space. All you got is a wrong plan... Fire the engines! More power, rabbit! Well done, boy. That\\'s Nidavellir! - Damn it. - What\\'s damn it? - The mechanism is crippled. - What? With the iris closed, I can\\'t heat the metal. - How long will it take to heat it? - A few minutes, maybe more. Why? - I\\'m gonna hold it open. - That\\'s suicide. So is facing Thanos without that axe. - How are we looking, Bruce? - Yeah, I think I\\'m getting the hang of it. It\\'s so amazing! It\\'s like being the Hulk without actually... I\\'m okay. I got two heat signatures breaking through the treeline. Thank you for standing with us. Of course, brother. Where\\'s the other friend? He will pay for his life with yours. Thanos will have that stone. That\\'s not gonna happen. You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust, and blood. We, have blood to spare. - They surrender? - Not exactly. Yibambe! Yibambe! Yibambe! What the hell? Looks like we pissed her off. They\\'re killing themselves. See the teeth on those things? Alright, back up, Sam. They ain\\'t get your wings yet. Cap, if these things circle the  perimeter and get in behind us, there\\'s nothing between them and Vision. Then we better keep them in front of us. How do we do that? We open the barrier. On my signal, open northwest section 17. Requesting confirmation, my King. You said open the barrier? - On my signal. - This will be the end of Wakanda. Then it will be the noblest ending in history. Wakanda forever! Wakanda forever! Now! - How much longer, Shuri? - We\\'ve barely begun, brother. You might want to pick up the pace. All fathers, give me strength. You understand, boy? You\\'re about to take the full force of a star. It\\'ll kill you. And if I die? Yes, that\\'s what, killing you means. Hold it, hold it, Thor! Thor? Say something, come on. Thor, you okay? - I think he\\'s dying. - He needs the axe. Where\\'s the handle? Tree! Help me find the handle. There\\'s too many of them! You guys are so screwed now! Bring me Thanos! Oh, yeah. You\\'re much more of a Thanos. I take it that Maw is dead? This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission. You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with a Master of the Mystic Arts. Where do you think he brought you? Let me guess. Your home? It was. And it was beautiful. Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution. Genocide? At random. Dispassionate, fair. The rich and poor alike. And they called me a madman. And what I predicted, came to pass. Congratulations. You\\'re a prophet. I\\'m a survivor. Who wants to murder trillions. With all six Stones, I could simply snap my fingers. They would all cease to exist. I call that mercy. And then what? I finally rest. And watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.  The hardest choices require the strongest wills. I think you\\'ll find our will equal to yours. \"Our\"? - Piece of cake, Quill. - Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off! Boom! Don\\'t let him close his fist. Magic! More magic! Magic with a kick! Magic with a... Insect. - Well, well. - You should have killed me. Would have been a waste of parts! Where\\'s Gamora? Is he under? Don\\'t let up. Be quick. He is very strong. Parker, help. Get over here. She can\\'t hold him much longer. Let\\'s go. I thought you\\'d be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where\\'s Gamora? - My Gamora! - Oh, bullshit! Where is she? - He is in anguish. - Good. He... He mourns. What does this monster have to mourn? Gamora... What? He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone. She didn\\'t. Okay, Quill? You gotta cool it right now, understand? Don\\'t. Don\\'t engage. We almost got this off! Tell me she\\'s lying. Asshole! Tell me you didn\\'t do it. I had to... No you didn\\'t. - No! No, you didn\\'t! - Quill! Just stop! Stop! It\\'s coming, I got it, I got it! Oh, God. Come and get some, face-dogs! Come on! Get some, get some! - How much for the gun? - Not for sale. Okay, how much for the arm? Oh, I\\'ll get that arm. - New haircut? - I notice you\\'ve copied my beard. Oh, by the way, this is a friend of mine. A tree. I am Groot! I am Steve Rogers. Fall back! Fall back now! Focus all fire on the left flank, Sam. I\\'m doing it. Why was she up there all this time? She\\'s on the field. Take it. Guys, we got a Vision situation here. - Somebody get to Vision! - I got him. On my way. He\\'ll die alone. As will you. She\\'s not alone. Oh, no. Oh, no, you don\\'t. This isn\\'t gonna be like New York, pal. This  suit\\'s already kicked the crap outta the Hulk. Guys. Vision needs back-up now. Hulk? I know you\\'re not making your entrance \\'till the last second. This is it, man. This is the last, last second. Hulk! Hulk! Shit, Hulk! - No! - Screw you, you big, green asshole! I\\'ll do it myself. Come on. See ya! Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal. I thought you were a formidable machine. But you\\'re dying, like any man. Get outta here! Go! That\\'s really gross. I thought I told you to go. We don\\'t trade lives, Captain. I got you, I got you! Sorry I can\\'t remember any of your names. You\\'re full of tricks, wizard. But you never once used your greatest weapon. A fake. You throw another moon at me, and I\\'m gonna lose it. - Stark. - You know me? I do. You\\'re not the only one cursed with knowledge. My only curse is you. All that for a drop of blood. You have my respect, Stark. When I\\'m done, half of humanity will still be alive. I hope they remember you. Stop. Spare his life, and I will give you the Stone. No tricks. Don\\'t! One to go. Where is he? Did we just lose? Why would you do that? We\\'re in the endgame now. Are you okay? What? What is it? He\\'s here. Everyone on my position. We have incoming. What the hell? Cap. That\\'s him. Eyes up. Stay sharp. Wanda. It\\'s time. No. They can\\'t stop him, Wanda. But we can. Look at me. You have the power to destroy the stone. - Don\\'t. - You must. Please... We are out of time. - I can\\'t. - Yes, you can. You can. If he gets this stone, half the Universe dies. It\\'s not fair. It shouldn\\'t be you, but it is. It\\'s all right. You could never hurt me. I just feel you. I love you. I understand, my child. Better than anyone. You could never. Today, I lost more than you can know.  But now is no time to mourn. Now... is no time at all. No! I told you... You\\'d die for that. You should have... You... You should have gone for the head! No! Daughter? Did you do it? Yes. What did it cost? Everything. What did you do? What did you do?! Where did he go? Thor... Where did he go? Steve? Up, General, up! This is no place to die. I am Groot... No. No. No. No. No! Groot... No... Sam? Sam, where you at? Something\\'s happening... Quill? - Stay, Quill. - Oh, man... Tony. There was no other way. Mr. Stark? I don\\'t feel so good... - You\\'re all right. - I don\\'t, I don\\'t know what\\'s happening... I don\\'t wanna go. I don\\'t wanna go. Mr. Stark, please... Please. I don\\'t wanna go. I don\\'t wanna go. I\\'m sorry. He did it. What is this? What the hell is happening? Oh, God. Subbed by: iamdepressed Search for Stark. No not yet. I\\'m watching every satellite above kind of searching Stark over there. - What is it? - Multiple bogets from wakanda. Same energy signatures as in New York? 10 times bigger. Call Clint. We\\'ll meet him... They okay? There is no one here. Call control. Code RED. Nick. No! Oh no! SENDING... Captain Marvel. '],\n",
       " 'Ant-Man and the Wasp': ['1 Gone forever. Telling you that she wasn\\'t coming home, was the hardest thing that I ever had to do. But then, Scott showed up... Or should I say, broke into our house. And when he went to the Quantum Realm.... And came back, everything changed. I started to wonder... Could your Mother still be alive? So I dusted off some old plans. Dad, what are you saying? I think it\\'s possible, to bring her back. Okay. We\\'re in. Aw, this place is a maze. Where\\'s that map? We\\'re definitely close. - Are you ready? - I\\'m ready, Daddy. Are you sure? Once we\\'re inside, you show any hesitation or fear, - we\\'re done. - I eat fear for breakfast. Wow. That is super cool. Come on. Look! It\\'s Anton. He\\'ll show us the way. Anton, which way do we go? Anton, which way do we go? Thanks, Anton. Look! The ants have burrowed into the tech facility. Oh, no! Lasers! Oh! I got lased! The secret vault. - Tell me you brought the contact lens. - Yup! Perfect! Right there. There! It\\'s the microtreasure. My trophy? - It looks like treasure. - Oh, it is to me. - I wanna take it to show and tell. - Oh, you can\\'t do that. Can\\'t. It never leaves the house. It\\'s too important. This is the best birthday present you ever got me. I\\'m so touched you think I\\'m the World\\'s Greatest Grandma. - It was the only one they have. - It makes me wanna get you a sweater. - Oh, no, the fuzz! - Hey, Scotty. I was looking at the schematics for the Karapetyan buildings, and I think we have way too many security cams, don\\'t we? - No, not at all. - \\'Cause, it\\'s a lot of security cameras. I know what he needs. Who\\'s the security expert in our business? You are. But I\\'m running the company, right? And if we overcoat him, he\\'s gonna go somewhere else, so we got to land this bird. He can go on anywhere. And the expression is \"landing the fish.\" No, it\\'s \"land the bird.\" Just like landing a plane. You gotta land the plane to be in business. I know it\\'s silly to get hung up on these kinds of things. But I do... How am I gonna land a fish? It can\\'t walk. And if it swam up on shore, and it battled a hawk, who\\'s gonna win? You\\'ve really turned me around on this thing. It\\'s okay. We\\'re gonna land Karapetyan. Now if you\\'d just excuse me, I\\'m in the middle of trying to steal something with my daughter. I\\'m gonna go recheck it. Don\\'t just stand there! Let\\'s bounce before the po-po come back! Po-po? How do you even know that? Let\\'s fly, Antoinette! Let\\'s fly! Crash landing! - I wish we could shrink for real. - It is pretty cool. Hey, I\\'m headed to the office, Scotty. Hey, sorry about freaking out earlier, you know? But I feel like... I\\'m way better. Like, my heart is definitely like, beating way too hard and stuff? And, like, my hands are shaking. But I think it\\'s unrelated, you know? It\\'s gonna be great, Luis. You got nothing to worry about. Yeah, yeah. I\\'m the boss. I\\'m the boss. I\\'m the boss. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Daddy! Come on, Woo. I\\'ve got three days left. - Why would I try to escape? - Sorry, Scott. Rules are rules. You trip a perimeter alarm and we search the place. Keel, stern, suits and nuts. Thank you. It was an accident. My foot went through the fence. Our flying ant crashed. Hey, you try and entertain a 10-year old when you can\\'t leave the house. You know the lengths that I\\'ve gone to? Close-up magic. I learned that. Why can\\'t you just leave my Daddy alone? Oh, Cassie. This must all seem like a bunch of confusing grown-up stuff to you, huh? Well, think of it this way:   Your school has rules, right? Like... You can\\'t draw on the walls. Well, your Daddy went to Germany and drew on the walls with Captain America. And that was a violation of Article 16, Paragraph 3 of the Sokovia Accords. Now as a part of his joint plea deal with Homeland Security and the German government, he\\'s allowed to return to the U.S., provided he serve two years under house arrest, followed by three years of probation. And avoid any unauthorized activities, technology, or contact with any former associates, who were or currently are, in violation of said Accords. Or any related statutes. Okay, sweetie? Wow. You\\'re really great with kids! Thanks. I\\'m also a youth pastor. Anyway, not to be a Johnny Ass-calade, but you haven\\'t had any contact with Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne, have you? - No. - You sure? Because it\\'s only a matter of time before we get them. It was their tech, so they violated the Accords, too. Associating with them breaks your deal. And, uhh... I don\\'t need to remind you, that... Any violation of your agreement means 20 years in prison. Minimum. I haven\\'t talked to Hank or Hope in forever. - They hate his guts. - Thanks, Peanut. - How\\'d you do it, Scott? - Do what? The card trick? Seriously? Oh, my God! You people can\\'t just show up here, whenever you want and search the place. Actually, they can. - You need a warrant. - Actually, they don\\'t. Really? Wow. - Did you pack your soccer shoes? - Yeah. Next time I see you, will be on the outside! I\\'ll get on the inside of this. - Three days! - Seriously? - I\\'m proud of you, buddy. - Thank you. - You know what? Give me another one. - Me, too! Freedom, business, I\\'m sensing greatness. - I had a fun weekend, Daddy. - Me too, Peanut. Just wait till next weekend. Once I\\'m outta  here, we\\'re gonna go paint this town red. We\\'ll have so much ice cream, we\\'ll never stop puking. - You\\'re getting good at that. - How\\'d you do that? - Bye, Daddy! - Bye! - Bye! - Bye! Three days... Easy-peasy. Snap your fingers. That gets them to look over there. Now that is misdirection. Easy-peasy. Lost... in the Quantum Realm. What? I\\'m gonna find you, Jellybean. I found you! You always find me, Mommy. What the hell? Hey, Hank. It\\'s been a while. Umm... I don\\'t even know if this is your number... Anymore... and, I\\'m probably the last person you wanna hear from. But... I just had a really weird dream. And I know that doesn\\'t sound like an emergency or anything, but it just felt... Very real. I was back in the Quantum Realm, and... I think I saw your wife. And then I was your wife. I mean, not in a weird way, or... You know... Hearing this out loud, I\\'m thinking, it\\'s not an emergency. I\\'m sorry I bothered you. I\\'m sorry for a lot of things. Hope? Is this another dream? Do you think it\\'s a dream? Or is it possible that you really saw my Mom down there? I\\'m not sure. I can\\'t be here! I can\\'t be, I\\'m under house arrest. They won\\'t open while the system\\'s engaged, Scott. You have to take me home. - They can show up any second. - Relax... As far as your nanny cops know, you\\'re still at home. Woah! Scotty? He\\'s programmed to replicate your daily routine. Nine hours in bed, five hours in front of the TV, two hours in the bathroom, whatever that\\'s about. That\\'s totally inaccurate. How do you know about my daily routine? Are you spying on me? We keep tabs on all security threats, all right? And so far, the biggest one we\\'ve had is you. I\\'m sorry about Germany.  They just showed up. They said it was a matter of national security, - That Cap needed help. - Who\\'s Cap? ...tain America. Captain... Cap. It\\'s what we call him. If you\\'re a friend. I think I\\'m a friend, a little. I know him. He\\'s not, we\\'re not... I\\'m sorry! All right? I didn\\'t think I\\'d get caught. You didn\\'t think about a lot of things. How\\'s Hank? We\\'re still running, the house is gone. So is our freedom. How do you think he is? I\\'m sorry. I know you\\'re mad. I\\'m not looking for apologies, Scott. The only reason why we\\'re even talking is because we need what\\'s in your head. Is this where you\\'re living? If you need help, money or something, maybe I can... We\\'re fine. Hey, Hank. Look... - I just want to... - Save it. - Can we start? - Yeah. So, while you were relaxing at home, we were building this. It\\'s a tunnel. To the Quantum Realm. To my Mom. We think she might still be down there, we just don\\'t know where. What? If we can pinpoint my Mom\\'s location, then the pod can take me down to get her. You built all this and you don\\'t even know if she\\'s alive? It\\'s called a hypothesis. Last night we powered up the tunnel for the first time. It overloaded, and it shut down. But for a split second, the doorway to the Quantum Realm was opened. And? And five minutes later, you called. Talking about Mom. We think when you went down there, you may have entangled with her. Hank, I would never do that. I respect you too much. Quantum entanglement, Scott. We think she might have put some kind of message in your head. Hopefully, a location. And opening the tunnel triggered it. Your Mom put a message in my head? Come on. That\\'s insane. No, Scott. Insane... is going to Germany without telling us and fighting the Avengers.  Just tell me you weren\\'t lying about the suit you took. Tell me you really destroyed it. I did. I destroyed it. I swear. I can\\'t believe you destroyed my suit. That was my life\\'s work. - What was I supposed to do? - You were supposed to not take my suit! I\\'m sorry, Hank. I\\'m sorry I took the suit. I\\'m sorry that I called last night. I don\\'t remember seeing Janet down there. I wish that I did. I just had a dream about her playing hide and seek with a little girl. What? I had a dream. She was playing hide and seek with a little... girl. Cassie and I do it all the time. It doesn\\'t mean anything. But, was it Cassie in the dream? No. - Where was she hiding? - What? The little girl, where was she hiding. Was it in a wardrobe? No, it\\'s in a tall dresser. - You mean a wardrobe. - Is that what that\\'s called? - What color was it? - Red. - Were there horses on it? - Oh, boy. It\\'s where I hid every time we played. Doesn\\'t sound like you really got the gist of the game. She\\'s alive! I knew it. I knew it! - We need to get that part. - Okay. The sooner we get the tunnel working, the sooner we can get this message out his head. - Does Burch have it? - Yeah. Let\\'s go. What part? Who\\'s Burch? Wait, what\\'s happening? We need a component to stop the tunnel from overloading again. I brought your clothes. You might wanna change. Look. I\\'d really like to help you out. But if I\\'m not home when they come to take off my ankle monitor then I\\'m going away forever. Once we get the component and power up the tunnel, we\\'ll get the message and have you home by lunch. We have to hurry. The entanglement won\\'t last. You owe us. All right, fine. But can I just wait inside? Because I\\'m not supposed to be out here. Let\\'s go. - We good?  - Yeah. I\\'ll be right back. - Can I have one of those? - No. Susan! - Welcome to Oui! - Sonny. Oui is French for yes. As in, yes, we found a table, yes, you saw us, and yes, to planning before property. Well, let\\'s hope it also means yes to do you have the component I ordered? You know, I\\'ve always loved your sense of humor, Susan. - Have a seat. - No, I\\'m good. Thank you. - Who is this guy? - Sonny Burch. He traffics in black market technology. He\\'s been getting us what we need to build the tunnel. - Can I just have one? - No. You know, I have a special friend, down at the FBI. And I say special, because... Well, he tells me things that I didn\\'t previously know. For example... Your name isn\\'t Susan. It\\'s Hope Van Dyne. And your unseen associate, that\\'s your father, Hank Pym. - That\\'s not good, Hank. - No shit. What do you want? Relationships are built on trust, Hope. And I want our relationship to have a strong foundation. - Our relationship? - Well, business landscape\\'s been shifting, Hope. Hell, screw it. I don\\'t even exist anymore. But now, Hank Pym? - Hank Pym, is a real opportunity. - Do you have a point? You think that I don\\'t know what you\\'ve been building? With all of this? Quantum technology. And you can forget nano-tech. Forget AI. Forget cryptocurrency. Quantum energy is the future. It\\'s the next gold rush. I want in, Hope. So, as a gesture of goodwill, I\\'ve taken the liberty of arranging some buyers for your lab. Starting bid? One billion dollars. Thank you, Sonny. Really. But my father and I have something slightly more pressing than starting a business. So, I\\'ll just take the component. As arranged. My buyers don\\'t take no for an answer. So, we\\'re either in business together, or we aren\\'t in business together.  - Then, I guess we aren\\'t. - You can go. But, I\\'m afraid your money\\'s gonna have to remain. Let\\'s call it compensation for my injured feelings. Listen, Sonny. This is gonna be so much easier on everybody if you just give me that component. No, the only thing you\\'re taking from here, is my heart. But it will mend in time. Okay. - So now, what? - You\\'ll see. She said her and daddy had something pressing. I wanna know what it is, \\'cause if they\\'re not working with us, they\\'re working with somebody. So find out. Name... Hold on. You gave her wings? Not my 36-feet chandelier! Stop firing! Stop! Alright, take this. Go. Go, go, go, go! Wings and blasters. I take it you didn\\'t have that tech available for me? No, I did. It\\'s a pleasure doing business with you, Sonny. Oh, our business isn\\'t finished yet, Hope. I can assure you of that. What the hell is that? Dad, are you seeing this? Hope, get out of there! - I gotta do something. - Wait! It\\'s still a work in progress. You taught me that kick. Remember? - Yeah, great form. - Those were the days. - Whatever happened to us? - Not the time, Scott. Dammit, where did he go? I lost it. I\\'m not seeing anything on the ant cams. Dad? Give me that. Now. - Are you okay? - No. He got the lab. - No. - Come on. - What was that? - I don\\'t know. But we need to find somewhere to regroup and figure out where the lab is. So where to now? How about my house? Mmm? I\\'m supposed to be there anyway. - Woo could walk in any second. - Exactly why we\\'re not going to your house. What about your house? Sorry. There is one place I can think of. No. No, no! No! No! No! Wow, Dr. Pym. Like, who would\\'ve thought that, once again, in your hour of need, that you  would turn to us? You know? Not me. Help yourself. That was overexpensive pastry. We gotta keep the food budget down. Well, what are we supposed to have for breakfast? - The oatmeal packets. - Oatmeal packets. - It\\'s insult. - Why\\'s it insult? - Because it takes like sand. - You know why? Cause it\\'s organic. - That is not organic. It\\'s sand. - The most important meal of the day. You know what, you can get creative with it. Put a little brown sugar on it. Sprinkle some cinnamon... Guys, guys, guys, guys! Come on, man! We got bigger fish to fry. - Is that my desk? - Yeah. What? Why do I have such a small desk? - Cause you weren\\'t there when we\\'re choosing desks. - You snooze, you lose. - I was under house arrest. - Yeah! You know what, this isn\\'t even a desk. This is garbage. You found this outside amongst garbage. I got it out of rummage sale. - So, you saved money on my desk? - Guys. Hope, please! We need to focus. All right? We gotta find that lab already. Geez. Oh, you know what? I heard stories, like what happened to you. Like this crazy, creepy cat who like, walks through walls and stuff. Like a... Like a Ghost! Like Baba Yaga. Baba Yaga. A witch. They tell stories to children to frighten them. You know Baba Yaga? Whoever stole it... We need to find it. Well, you don\\'t find someone like that. - They find you. - Like Baba Yaga. Dr. Pym, you\\'re like the smartest genius I know. Did you put some kind of lojack on your lab? Because if you didn\\'t, we have a variety of affordable options. Of course, I did, Luis. It was disabled. Whoever stole the lab knew exactly what they were doing. - They also looked like they were phasing. - Phasing? Quantum phasing. When an object moves through different states of matter.  Oh, yeah. That\\'s what I was thinking. The lab emits radiation. Could we modify a quantum spectrometer and track it? That could work, yes. But all of my equipment is in the lab. Well, where else can we find that equipment? Well, there is one person. - Bill Foster. - Great! Who\\'s Bill Foster? He\\'s an old colleague of my Dad\\'s. From SHIELD. - They had a falling out years ago. - You seem to have a lot of falling outs with people. It\\'s probably just a waste of time. Hey, I\\'m risking everything by being here. Don\\'t you think we should check? We need to find out who took the lab. Guys, it\\'s not a good idea to be out in the open like this. Relax. No one\\'s gonna recognize us. What, because of hats and sunglasses? It\\'s not a disguise, Hank. We look like ourselves in a baseball game. In an isolated system... Particles co-exist in a stable phase relationship. If the system is interfered with, that stability becomes chaos. Unpredictable. Dangerous. Beautiful. Isolated completely, a quantum system would revert back to separate states of matter. Each entangled with a distinct state of its environment. In other words... The object in question would be both in and out of phase with multiple parallel realities. Speaking of being out of phase with reality... I am noticing an unusally high number of glazed eyes out there among you. So, why don\\'t we call it a few minutes early. That will be enough for today, thank you, ladies and gentlemen. You may go. It\\'s incredible. Your link to Janet. It\\'s Quantum entanglement, between the quantum states composed of her molecules and your brains. Yeah. It\\'s what I was thinking. Do you guys just put the word \\'quantum\\' in front of everything? Doctor, we need to find our lab. Hope, I\\'d love to help you but I don\\'t  have the equipment you\\'re describing. I told you this was a waste of time. Come on. Let\\'s go. Don\\'t condescend, Hank. You\\'re the one who\\'s on the run from the FBI. All because you had to grow to a size that finally fit your ego. That wasn\\'t me in Germany. It was this idiot. Really? Going that big must\\'ve been exhausting. I slept for three days straight. You have no idea. Actually, I do. Back in the day, I was Hank\\'s partner in a project called Goliath. Excuse me, you were my partner? The only thing more tiring than going that big, is putting up with Hank\\'s bullshit. How big did you get? My record? Twenty-one feet. - Not bad. - You? - I don\\'t... - No, really. I\\'m curious. - Sixty-five feet. Yeah. - Whoa. - Huge. - Sixty-five. If you two are finished comparing sizes... We need to figure out a way to track down the lab. And the great Hank Pym hasn\\'t figured that one out yet? Strange. He had all the answers back in the day. That\\'s why I left the project. Left? I fired you. Best decision I ever made. Hank was a terrible partner. Temperamental. Stubborn. Impatient. Sooner or later he just pushed everyone away. Just the mediocrities. Janet was the only one who could endure him and chose to stick it out. Watch it, Bill. She paid the price though, didn\\'t she? You son of a... We didn\\'t come here to listen to you two squabble. I\\'m trying to save my Mother. It\\'s Woo. Someone must have seen me. Relax. If this is about you they\\'d be in your house by now. - What are you, fifteen? - Come on. We gotta go, right now. Wait! You might be able to improvise that tracker. If you modify the defraction units on one of your regulators. - That could work. - I don\\'t know what that means.  Thank you. But Doctor, campus police says they ID\\'d both Pym and Van Dyne. I don\\'t know what to tell you, agent. I haven\\'t talked to Hank in thirty years. I can assure you I\\'m the last person he would wanna visit. - Oh, come on. You expect us to... - Hey, hey. - Why is that? - Simple. We hate each other\\'s guts. So I\\'m a terrible partner? Foster, he hasn\\'t had one good idea in his unremarkable career. But his idea about the defractors could work. Fine, one decent idea. Except I eliminated the defractors when I upgraded the suits. So if we had an old suit, we might be able to track down the lab? Yes. But we don\\'t. - What if we did? - What do you mean? I mean... - Life\\'s funny... - Oh, my God. - You didn\\'t destroy the suit. - What?! Well, it was your life\\'s work, Hank. I couldn\\'t destroy that. Before I turned myself in, I shrunk it down and mailed it to Luis. You sent my suit through the mail? Hey, the postal service is very reliable, you know? They do tracking numbers now. Like UPS. Where is it? It\\'s in a very safe place, alright? Don\\'t worry. What, the trophy? No, it\\'s not here. What do you mean it\\'s not there? Where could it be? I\\'ve looked everywhere. It\\'s not here. Hey. Get away from the table. I put it back out to Cassie, and I... Show and tell. Scotty? Well, the good news is, I know where it is. Whenever you go back to school, isn\\'t everything supposed to look so much smaller? This place seems huge. Ah! - What is it? - It\\'s the new regulator. Hank, what\\'s going on with this suit? How much of a work in progress is this? Uh-oh. Oh, no. No, no, no. What, are you laughing? Please, can you just... Okay. Okay. What do you see? The sizing coils are malfunctioning. Just let me... Oww! - Sorry. - It\\'s all right.  Okay. All right. Try it now. So... Awesome. If only Cap could see you now. Hilarious. What are we gonna do? Hey! Where\\'s your hall pass? Hey, I\\'m talking to you. Hey! Hey... You can do it. You almost got it! Oh, Peanut. Okay. Let\\'s go. Hiya, Champ! How was school today? Hahaha. Alright, get your jokes out now. - Can you fix the suit? - He\\'s so cranky. You want a juice box and some string cheese? Do you really have that? Let\\'s see if Foster was right. This has got to be the lab. - Let\\'s go get it. - Yeah. This seems right. Look at us. Teaming up twice in one day. Makes you think, huh? - About what? - Germany? - What do you mean? - We were working together. Training together. And, other stuff-ing together. If I\\'d have asked you, would you have come? I guess we\\'ll never know. But I do know one thing. What? If I had, you\\'d have never been caught. Hey, Scott. You think you can stop daydreaming about my daughter long enough to get my lab? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Okay. You\\'re transmitting. What took you so long? Sorry, I had to come up with a name for my ant. I\\'m thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant. - Like it? - Hilarious. I\\'m not getting anything on the monitors. There\\'s some kind of electronic disturbance. - Be careful. - You know me, Hank. I\\'m always care--- Whoa! - It\\'s okay. It\\'s just a suit. - How do you know? Look. That\\'s Ghost? What is she doing? You think that suit is how she goes through walls and stuff? Let\\'s just get out of here before she wakes up. Hope, look. There\\'s the lab. We\\'re sure this is our shrunken building and not somebody else\\'s, right? Just take it, Scott. We gotta be fast. I\\'ll get it. Oh, sh... Hope. Hank. Guys? I don\\'t think they can hear you. Hi. I\\'m Ava.  Scott. So... You don\\'t need a suit to, uhh... You know. Go through things. No. It just helps me control it. And the pain. Supposedly. You\\'re not gonna reach into my chest and crush my heart, are you? You\\'re funny. I\\'m not gonna hurt you Scott, unless I have to. I need... What\\'s in your head. Let\\'s wake up the rest of the gang and get this over with, shall we? Get up! Come on! Dad? Don\\'t ever touch him again. Now, now, Hope... I think I\\'m being rather gentle with your Father, all things considered. What the hell are you talking about? Another casualty of Hank Pym\\'s ego. Bill. What have you done? It\\'s what you\\'ve done, Dr. Pym. You with her? Aw, man. I thought you were cool. What the hell is going on here? I doubt Hank have ever mentioned my Father. Why would he? Elihas Starr. They were colleagues at SHIELD. Quantum research. Until my Father dared to disagree with the great Hank Pym. You had him fired. Oh, and discredited for good measure. My father tried to continue his research on his own. Desperate to restore his name, so he took risks. No! Too many. Until something went wrong. He told us to run. - Elihas, what\\'s happening? - Just go. Go! Daddy! I can tell he was scared. - Daddy! - Ava, no! I didn\\'t want him to be alone. No! No! When I woke up, my parents were dead. I wasn\\'t so lucky. They call it \"Molecular Disequilibrium.\" A rather dull name, I think. Doesn\\'t quite do justice to what it means. Every cell, in my body, is torn apart and stitched back together. Over, and over, everyday. I was still at SHIELD when I got the call about a \"quantum anomaly\" in Argentina. Hello, Ava. My name is Bill. I was a friend of your Father\\'s. I brought you something. It\\'s all right. Try again. That\\'s it. Dr. Foster did his  best to keep me safe. But others at SHIELD saw an opportunity in my affliction. They built me a containment suit so I can control my phasing. And trained me to be a stealth operative. They weaponized me. I stole for them, spied for them... I killed for them. And in exchange for my soul, they were going to cure me. They lied. When SHIELD collapsed, I took Ava in. I built the chamber to slow her decay, but her condition was progressive. I didn\\'t know how to cure her. She wanted to kill you, Hank. But I told her, no. And that she should watch you instead. And sure enough, she discovered that you were building a tunnel. Then she told me about Lang. And the message from Janet inside his head... - For Christ\\'s sake! - That\\'s me. I\\'m sorry. Look, can you tell me who\\'s texting me? Cassie. 911. That\\'s my daughter. I need to text her back. No. That\\'s not happening. It\\'s 911. That means it\\'s an emergency! You\\'re not making demands here, Lang. You\\'re not appreciating the gravity of the... Okay, well, she\\'s trying to videochat me now. Something might be wrong. Let me talk to her. Please! Cassie, are you okay? What\\'s the emergency? - I can\\'t find my soccer shoes. - What? I have a game tomorrow. Hey, Scott, I know that they\\'re there. Can you just walk the phone around the house? - No, I can\\'t do that right now. - Why not? Because I\\'m sick. Hey, can you just maybe look around later then call me back? Please? Thank you. - Bye, Daddy! - Bye, Peanut! - Feel better! - Feel better, buddy! I\\'m sorry. It\\'s that emergency. Ava, I wanna help you. She doesn\\'t need your help. I know how to save her. - Oh, really? How? - Janet. For the last 30 years, she\\'s been down there absorbing quantum energy. We can extract that energy. We can use it  to repair Ava\\'s molecular structure... - Extract it? - Yes! Are you insane? That would rip Janet apart! You don\\'t know that. I\\'m gonna fire up your tunnel. When Janet\\'s location pops into Lang\\'s head, he\\'s gonna give it to me, - or I\\'m gonna turn him over to the FBI. - What? You\\'re gonna stay here just in case I need your help. - Like hell, I would help you! - You\\'ll do whatever I say. - You\\'re gonna kill Janet. - I\\'d be more worried about yourself, Hank. Goddammit, Bill! - Dad? - Calm down, Hank. So help me, God... It\\'s his heart! He needs his pills, please. Dr. Foster, they\\'re in the tin, please. He could die! For... come on! Help him! Dad, just hang on, alright? Just keep breathing. Stay calm. - Help him, man! Come on! - The Altoid tin! Wait! Thanks, guys! Hank! Bill is filling that girl\\'s head with lies. Elihas Starr was a traitor. He stole my plans. Now, bring her down. Right, lock it in. No, no, no. The bolt is on the other side. Tighten that one down, then bring her down with one knock. - Good job. - It\\'ll work. Foster, he could\\'ve fried the entire system. Look, we\\'ll adjust the relays while you go reprogram the settings. All right? It\\'s gonna be fine. - So, this is it. - Yeah. You\\'d think with all this time to prepare, I\\'d be more ready. Well, going subatomic isn\\'t something you can prepare for. It kind of, melts your mind. - I mean, seeing my Mom again. - Oh. What if she\\'s a completely different person? Yeah, like George Washington? - I\\'m serious, Scott. - Or, George Jefferson? What if she\\'s forgotten about me? When I was in prison... The only thing that got me through was Cassie. I could\\'ve been locked up for 100 years. I never would\\'ve forgotten her. I know your Mom is counting the  minutes until she can see you again. Thank you. - Hey. - We\\'ve got a big problem. You forgot the motion sensor lights on the back of the building. No. They\\'re on the proposal, and Karapetyan asked for them specifically. Uh, yeah. Look, it\\'s been a little crazy... Look, maybe I can stop by tomorrow and take a look at it. No, no, no, no! The meeting is first thing in the morning. You gotta come right now and fix it. I can\\'t. I wish I could, but I can\\'t leave. You know what, I\\'m coming to you. I\\'ll just explain the plans, and get it on the laptop, and you can fix them in. - Just tell me where you are, okay? - It\\'s complicated. What do you mean, it\\'s complicated? As you can see, sir... This system is state-of-the-art. Security of tomorrow... today! Oh, that\\'s so good! I love the lead-in, Bro. Keep practicing. Hey, I just gotta drive on to Scotty\\'s, so he can fix the plans. But don\\'t worry. I\\'ll be back in plenty of time. As you can see, sir... Oh! Oh! Oh! Tell me you got the van washed for tomorrow morning. Down to the undercarriage, baby. - You sprung for the undercarriage wash? - Well, you said get the works. That\\'s a scam, Bro. We live in California, not Minnesota! He\\'s right. The undercarriage wash. That\\'s for cleaning off road salt. Laid out in all those snow-laden sister states. Who are you and why do you know so much about car wash protocol? Well, my name is Sonny Burch. And I do my research, Luis. To wit, I have learned, from a friend of mine, at the FBI, that you\\'re a known associate of Scott Lang. A known associate of Hank Pym. Who I\\'ve also learned, has a portable frickin\\' laboratory. Filled with all kinds of juicy tech. And you\\'re gonna tell me where it is. Well, I hate to break it to you, but I  don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. Well, I sense a resistance in you, Luis. And I have promised results to some dangerous people. So, I\\'m gonna introduce you, to my good friend Uzman. Now, Uzman, is a master at extracting information from the unwillin\\' through psychoactive means. Oh, is that truth serum? There\\'s no such thing as truth serum. That\\'s just nonsense from TV. - What is it, then? - It\\'s a little concoction, that he\\'s been perfecting since his days with the SIS. It makes you suggestible. And highly responsive. - Dude, that\\'s truth serum! - No, it\\'s not. No fencing, but, - this sound like truth serum to me. - Right?! - It\\'s not a truth serum. - Oh, okay. Hey, I believe you. It\\'s not a truth serum. If it walk like duck, and talk like ducks... It\\'s truth serum. Well, I have a lot of allergies. So... You might wanna think about that. Time to get that lab back. What? The chamber and the suit are barely helping anymore. How long have I got? A couple of weeks, maybe. Well then, we\\'ll make them bring the lab back. How? Lang. He has a daughter, right? You can\\'t mean that. Ava? I tolerate a lot of the things you do out there, but I won\\'t be a part of anything like that. You\\'re not the one who\\'s about to fade away into nothing, Bill. I am! You said you could fix me. You promised! I know. I will. But not like that. You let one finger on that little girl... I won\\'t help you. And we\\'re done. Fine. There are other options. You know what? You\\'re right. This isn\\'t truth serum. \\'Cause I don\\'t feel anything. That was a lie. I did feel something. - This is truth serum! - There\\'s no such thing. Okay! Okay, okay. Now I\\'m gonna make this real easy for you, Luis. Okay. Where... is Scott Lang?  Well, see, that\\'s complicated. \\'Cause when I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place. And I\\'m not talking about cell block D. His wife had just filed for divorce. And I was like, \"Damn, homie, she dumped you while you were in lock-up?\" And he\\'s like, \"Yeah, I know. I thought I was gonna be with her forever, but now, I\\'m all alone!\" And I was like, \"Damn, homie, you gotta chin up. \\'Cause you\\'ll find a new partner. But you know what? I\\'m Luis.\" And he says, \"You know what? I\\'m Scotty. And we\\'re gonna be best friends.\" Wait, hold on, hold on. Now I like a good story as much as the next person, but what\\'s this have to do with where Scott Lang is? I\\'m getting there, I\\'m getting there. You put a dime in him, you got to let the whole song play out. He hit like human jukebox. Oh! My abuelita had a jukebox in a restaurant. Yeah. Only played Morrissey. And if anybody ever complained, she\\'d be like, \"Oh, porque? Gusta mas?\" And El Chicanos, we call them mas, \"then, adios!\" What can I say? We relate to these melancholy bandits, you know? - Lang. - Right, right, right, right. So anyway, this guy gets out of jail and starts working for Hank. And that\\'s when he met Hope. And Hope\\'s all like, \"I want nothing to do with you. Look at my hairdo. I\\'m all business.\" And then Scotty\\'s like, \"You know what, girl? My heart\\'s all broken, and I\\'ll probably never find love again. But damn, if I want to kiss you!\" But then you fast-forward and they\\'re all like into each other, right? And then Scotty\\'s like, \"You know what, I can\\'t tell you this, but I\\'m gonna go trashing the airport with Captain America!\" Then she said, \"I can\\'t believe you split like that! Smell you later, dummy!\" So Scotty goes on house arrest, and he won\\'t admit it, but his heart\\'s all like,  \"Damn! I thought Hope could\\'ve been my new true partner. But I blew it!\" But fate brought them back together, and then Hope\\'s heart is all, \"I\\'m worried that I can\\'t trust him. And he\\'s gonna screw up again and ruin everything.\" And in my heart, it\\'s all like, \"That fancy raspberry filling represents the company\\'s rent. And we\\'re days away from going out of business! Oooh!\" - Out of business? - Days away?! Damn truth serum! I was trying to protect you guys. I swear to God. I was trying to be a good boss. But we\\'re broke. And the Karapetyans are our last hope, and if we don\\'t show up, we\\'re done! - That\\'s terrible bossing. - Damn, Bro! - That\\'s on me. That\\'s on me! - Hey! Enough. I\\'m gonna ask you one more time... Where is Scott Lang? I\\'ve been trying to tell you. He\\'s in a tricky spot, emotionally speaking. Emotionally speaking. But where is Scott Lang, literally speaking?! Oh! The woods. The woods? Baba Yaga! What do you mean, the woods? The Muir woods! For God\\'s sake! Baba Yaga, coming late, little children, sleep at eight. Damn it! If that freak gets Pym\\'s tech, I\\'m never gonna see it. So what do we do now? It\\'s easier to steal it from the feds than from a boogeyman. Hey. It\\'s me. How\\'d you like to get a promotion? I\\'ve got the location on Pym, Van Dyne, and Lang. But you\\'re gonna have to take them down now, \\'cause they ain\\'t gonna be there for long. And when you do, you\\'re gonna get me that lab. Understood. Good news, gentlemen. Feds are gonna do the hard work for us. What are you looking at? Change my tire! Sir... Can you knock? Sorry, sir. But I just got a lead. Ooh. I love leads. - Systems in the green. - Priming the coils. Full charge. Soon as the tunnel\\'s open, let us know if you  get anything that could be part of her message. Yeah, yeah. I will. Okay, then. Here it goes. We did it! You got anything? Nothing. Just give it a minute. Because it could... No. No, no, no! - What\\'s happening? - It\\'s shutting down. Maybe vectors are off. We\\'ve gone over them a million times. I know they\\'re right. - Well then, what else could it be? - I don\\'t know. - Scott, what are you doing? - Scott, get away from that! Scott, we had... I\\'m sorry. I don\\'t know how much time I have. I need to fix the algorithm. Trust me, after 30 years down here... I\\'ve thought about it a lot. Janet? Hi, Hon. Hello, Jellybean. Mom? It\\'s not the reunion I had imagined. It\\'s all so rushed. You two have done such great work. You just need a little... nudge. Janet, how is this possible? It wasn\\'t a message you put in Scott\\'s head. It was an antenna. Clever girl. I\\'m so proud of you. Honey, tell us where you are. Tell us how to find you. No, the probability fields are too complex. That\\'s why I needed to talk to you. You have to follow my voice. - Of course. - Like tracing a call back to its source. I\\'m tracking your signal using subatomic frequencies, between point 2 and point 9. - I\\'ve narrowed it to 4 and 6. - It\\'s too tight. We could miss you. Look at us squabbling again. Fine. Between 3 and 7. Our first fight in decades and it\\'s over just like that. Bull\\'s eye. - Source lock. - It\\'s you! Ha! We got it! You have to meet me in these exact coordinates. In the wasteland, beyond the quantum void. It\\'s very dangerous, especially on the human mind. So be careful. Time and space work very differently down here. You have two hours. After that, the probability fields will shift, and it\\'ll be another century  before they\\'ll align like this again. We\\'ll find you. I know you will, Jellybean. Nope. Nothing. I got nothing. No sign of Janet. How did we get up here? At first, you\\'ll see all kinds of lights, and it\\'s gonna get really trippy but then it\\'s gonna turn black and silent. Like, really silent. Scott, I\\'ll be fine. - I\\'m just saying. Cause I\\'ve been down there. - Yeah, so you\\'ve mentioned. Um, sorry. I have to take this. Hey, man. You coming? No, I\\'m not. But you know what? Ghost is. And you know what? The feds, they know where you are. - What? - I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry. They gave me some truth serum, then all of a sudden I started talking all honestly, like, I hate the way that you use the dishwasher. I hate it. But you need to go home because the feds are probably going there now! And by the way, who puts the plates on the top rack, okay? They don\\'t go there! I feel like such a jerk. You\\'re gonna be really mad. We gotta go. - What? - Ghost knows where we are. - So does the FBI. - How? - I told Luis where we are. - You what? I told him to come here, so I can help him with the Karapetyan proposal. Oh, my God! But... Look, we need to land that account. Otherwise, we\\'ll lose the business! Do you know how hard it is for ex- cons to find work these days? Jesus, Scott! 90 seconds to close the aperture. - You have to depolarize the coils first. - I know. I\\'m really sorry, but the... FBI is coming to my place, so... I have to go. Can I borrow the suit? Look, uhh... I\\'m just gonna borrow the suit. I\\'ll come back. Just tell me where you\\'ll be. - Don\\'t bother. - What? We\\'ll come and get the suit from you as soon as we find my Mom. - Hope... - Scott, just go! - Scott? - Daddy? - It\\'s us, buddy! - We\\'re here for Cassie\\'s shoes.  He must be resting. Honey, why don\\'t you go up the stairs and go look under your bed. Daddy? You upstairs? Daddy... What the? Really lives like a pig these days. Daddy? Spread out! - Again? - You people have no shame! - The monitor says that he\\'s in the bathroom. - Yeah. I\\'m not buying it. Cassie, let the man get by. - But Daddy\\'s super sick! - I\\'ll see about that. He says he doesn\\'t want anyone else to get sick. Well, I\\'ll take my chances, sweetie. He barfed. Like, a lot. Young lady, I\\'m a federal agent. I\\'ve seen worse things than vomit. - Like, a lot, a lot? - Yes! - Forget it. Move aside. - No! Woo! - What are you doing here? - Scott. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m just really sick. I told you. Excuse me. Sometimes you just gotta get it out, you know? Sorry. I\\'ll start the van. You get the lab. Freeze! You\\'re surrounded! Hank Pym. Hope Van Dyne. You\\'re under arrest. - This is harassment. - Actually, it\\'s not. What does the FBI even stand for? Forever Bothering Individuals? - His monitor check out? - Of course, it does. Damn it. It\\'s like I just got fed a bowl of malarkey. We got them, sir. Pym and Van Dyne are in custody. Seriously? Yes! Oh. Sorry, Scott. They were your friends. That\\'s insensitive. I just really needed a win, you know? Anyway... I\\'ll be back later for the official end of your sentence. Sorry for misjudging you, pal. You should feel great about yourself. What is it? We have a man down, and Pym\\'s lab is gone. Hey. - Thanks for covering for me. - Sure. So.. How long have you been Ant-Man again? Not long. Things just sort of happened. I\\'m sorry, for lying to you. I\\'m sorry for risking everything. - Dad, it\\'s okay. - That\\'s not... I do some dumb things, and the people that I love the most pay the price.  Mainly, you. Trying to help people isn\\'t dumb. Well... I screw it up just about every time. So maybe, you just need someone watching your back. Like a partner. Well, she\\'s made it clear that\\'s about the last thing she wants. - Who? - Hope. - What, who did you think? - Me. You? Don\\'t laugh. - I\\'d be a great partner. - Oh, Peanut! You would be awesome. And if I let you, I would be a terrible Dad. Fine. Have Hope be your partner. She\\'s smart. She reminds me of you. You gonna go help her? I think you should help her. I wish I could, but... I don\\'t know how I can help her without hurting you. You can do it. You can do anything. You\\'re the World\\'s Greatest Grandma. Agent Woo will see you in an hour. An hour? We don\\'t have an hour. Aww. You got somewhere else to be? Now, that\\'s my girl. Alright, what\\'s our plan? To shrink that wall. It looks load bearing. Ceiling could collapse... - Then we run like hell. - It\\'s made up of 15-20 agents on the floor. Roughly five times that in the building at large. - They\\'re all heavily armed. - Not great odds. - You got any better ideas? - Nope. But I\\'m not giving up on Mom. She\\'d be so proud of you. Okay. One... Two... Scott? What are you two just standing around for? We gotta go find that lab. What about me? Perfect. Hurry up and get dressed. We don\\'t have much time. Sir. Okay. Now what? You\\'re asking me? Get in! Hi. Hi. Uhh, excuse me. Are we planning on leaving soon, or are you two gonna keep staring at each other until they start shooting at us. - Hey, Burch. - Yeah? - Yeah. They\\'re out. - I\\'m on my way. - As soon as we see him, so was the van. - How could this happen? What the dickens? Thank you. You\\'re welcome. So, uhh... How do  we find the lab? After I lost it the first time, I put on a new tracker... ...of sorts. That\\'ll work. Is it ready or not? We can begin the extraction process now. Listen, Ava, this whole thing could be very dangerous. - Maybe, maybe we should... - Maybe we should what? Wait? I\\'ve got days until I\\'m dead. We\\'re doing this, Bill. Now. Energy readings show they have not used the tunnel yet. We don\\'t have much time before Mom\\'s location shifts and we lose her. Yeah, and we have a lot to do before that. You know, my Pap-pap always said if you wanna do something right, you make a list. So, we should do that. One, we have to break into that lab. Two, we have to kick out Foster and Ghost. Three, we have to fight Ghost. That seems like it should be part of 2. 2-A. Right? Let\\'s call it 2-A. Fight Ghost, 2-A. Oh! Also, we have to make sure that the lab is fully grown for you to come back. Otherwise we\\'re screwed... Scott... You want me to start again? I\\'ll start again. I\\'m going to dive. The only chance we\\'ve got is if the 2 of you are out here together, protecting the tunnel. Let me do this, Hope. Please. Let me get her. I think he\\'s right. Whassup? You remember that beloved commercial? Whassup? I had him follow us here. I thought we could use some help. All right. I\\'m in position. The ants are headed in. - Copy that. - Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty. - You want a pez? - No. Guess who gave me this for my birthday. By the way, I love that suit! Thanks, man. I wish I had a suit. I would even like a suit with like minimal powers, you know? Or maybe, even just a suit. With no powers. What is it? I don\\'t know. It\\'s them. They can\\'t be far. Hank? Hank? Stop it! Dad, what\\'s your status? Foster\\'s taken care  of. Suiting up, now. I just wanted to save Ava. She\\'s facing death or something far more terrible. She\\'s afraid. I\\'ll help you find a cure when I get back. I promise. Together, we\\'ll figure something out. Good luck, Hank. Thanks, Bill. Now, I\\'m gonna need you to step back. Time remaining: fifteen minutes. Hank\\'s in, Scott. Any sign of her? No. Nothing yet. Ava! Call off the ants, Scott. Oh, boy. Can I get a status report, cause I got some serious Ghost problems here! Ready to dive. - In case I don\\'t make it... - Don\\'t. Don\\'t say that. I can\\'t lose you, too. I love you, Hope. Guys, everything\\'s bad over here. Please... Now. Misdirection. One of the first things they teach you at Online Close-up Magic University. No! All right. We got it, Scotty. - Meet us at the rendezvous point. - Okay. On my way. Oh, no. Really? - This guy? Again? - Who? I told you our business wasn\\'t over. Change of plans. Hang on. I want that lab, boys. Whatever it takes. Hold on. Oh! That undercarriage is filthy! Now they have bigger problems. Hope, what are you doing? You\\'re heading away from the rendezvous point. Don\\'t worry. I\\'m taking these guys on the scenic route. Wait, what are you... Oh. No! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, we\\'re gonna die! We\\'re gonna die! Signal lost. What the hell are they doing up there? Recalibrating. Recalibrating. You never said it was so beautiful, Scott. Recalibrating. Okay. Anytime now. Recalibrating. - Recalibrating. - Come on. Signal restored. Bikes, it\\'s all on you. - Take the wheel. - What? Wait, Hope! Well, the 60\\'s were fun. But now, I\\'m paying for it! Be careful up there! Give me a break. I haven\\'t driven in two years. You got pez\\'d! Up here! Oh, that\\'s not good. Hope! No! There it is right there, the lab.  Get it, get, get, get the lab! I\\'ve got her. Westbound on Primo. Hope! Wait! Hey! What about me? We got you now, Ava! Not again! Piece of junk! Yes! Go. Go! Go, go, go, go! Burch got the lab. I\\'m going after him. No, no, no, no, no! Work in progress, my ass. Scott, where are you? I\\'ve got Burch in my sights. Hurry! - I\\'m coming, I\\'m coming! - We\\'re running out of time! Warning. Approaching quantum void. I\\'m coming to you, Honey. Guys... Don\\'t you need the remote to the lab? I just found it. We can\\'t grow the lab without it. Get it to us, fast. - Yeah, but the van is busted. - Use the Hot Wheels Rally case. Wha? I love you, Dr. Pym. The remote! We\\'re missing the remote. We gotta check the van. Huh? Awesome! Hey, I\\'m going left. But Burch\\'s boys are all over me. - I\\'m on my way. - Right. I\\'ll get the lab. Hi! Oh, that\\'s badass! Nice! Toink! Come here, you little weasel! Oh, no, you don\\'t! I guess... Well, maybe, you do. Come on! Anyone see a southern gentleman carrying a building? How did he even have time to buy a ticket? Just one time, please. Work! Yes! All right, I need help. That\\'s it. Oh... sorry! Hey! Come on, man! Not cool! Murderers! Yes! Yes! I\\'m gonna call you Ant-onio Banderas. \\'Cause you\\'re a badass! Yes! No. No. No! Ant-onio! Our friends the humpbacks dip in here to the San Francisco bay for a little leisure, - and a little breeding. - Listen, Uzman... Just meet me at the waterfront in three hours. Oh, folks, we barely left the dock, but it looks like we have some company! You see it, folks? There it is. There\\'s a breach. What the... Hi. Sorry. Hi. It\\'s okay, it\\'s okay. Sorry. No, I\\'m not a whale. This will just take a second. Hey! That doesn\\'t belong to you.  - No! No! No! No! - You\\'re embarassing yourself now. - Come on. Let go! - No! Thank you. I\\'ll take this now. No... ... melts your mind... ... a message in your head... ... I had a dream... Daddy? Dad? What\\'s going on? Why haven\\'t you found Mom? You look lost, Hank. Are you all right? Still think you have all the answers, Hank? It\\'s me. I\\'m so sorry! - It took so long. - No. I do know... You\\'re here now. Let\\'s go home. I thought I was gone. But that energy from your hands... How did you do that? I\\'m not the same woman I was 30 years ago, Henry. This place... It changes you. And adaptation is part of it, but some of it is... Evolution. Lab coordinates not found. Do not ascend. I should probably tell you what we\\'re dealing with up there. I got the lab. I got the lab. Move. Move... Move! Get out of the... Let\\'s go. No one here appears to be sure what this is. It seems he\\'s 90, 80, 85 feet tall. Get out of the way! I got the lab. The lab! Okay... The earth feels junky. Oh, no. He\\'s too big. - Scotty! - Scott! I\\'m gonna go to sleep. I\\'m just gonna go to sleep now for five minutes. I just need five minutes. Five minutes... You get the lab somewhere safe. Scott\\'s air won\\'t last! Okay! Move. Move. Move! No, wait! Lab at full scale. - They did it! - Ready to ascend. Let\\'s go see our daughter. Scott. Scott! Scott, come on. Wake up. Come on. Come on. Where are you, Scott? Gotcha. Scott? Hey! Hey, Scotty. Hope, come in. Do you take any questions \\'bout the building? - Sco... - Where\\'s the remote, Luis? It\\'s probably in there. I don\\'t have it. I don\\'t have it. I guess this is where we say, Adios, amigo. No, no, no! Thanks, guys. Ava? Ava! Ava. - Almost ready for extraction. - Please, stop. People are getting hurt.  Everything hurts. Don\\'t talk to me about pain. What if Hank was right? What if this process kills Janet? You\\'re worried about her? All I\\'m saying is she\\'s a brilliant scientist. She may be able to help. Oh, she will help. Right now. And if she dies, she dies! I\\'m sorry, we can\\'t do this. We have to find another way. This is the way. Janet! She\\'s starting the extraction. She\\'s gonna tear Mom apart. No! Hope! Are you okay? Mom? Oh, my God. We found you. I missed you so much. I missed you too, Jellybean. It\\'s okay. I\\'m, I\\'m here now. We have time. No more last minute business trips, okay? I promise. It\\'s okay, it\\'s fine. Don\\'t worry about me. - I\\'ll be fine. - Dad! Scott. Miss Van Dyne. It\\'s nice to... I guess we\\'ve already met. I guess we have. Wait. Your pain... I can feel it. It hurts. It always hurts. I\\'m sorry. I think I can help you. Do you know she could do that? It\\'s okay. Guys, the cops are coming. Whoa! The, uhh, the... The cops are coming. Like all of them. - I gotta go. - We gotta go. What about them? Hands in the air! No. No, no, we do our jobs. You see, we see these guys, they trying to shoot people. So we apprehended them. For you. You\\'re welcome. - We traffic in stolen technology. - And they have killed many, many people. - He\\'s in charge. - That\\'s true. I am. I\\'ve also committed numerous healthcode violations in my restaurant. Some of them would shock you. It is truth serum. We gotta get out of here. Fast. I have an idea. Giant figure now spotted at the intersection of Broadway and Wycona. - All units move in. - Go. Go. There he is. It\\'s over, Scotty. I\\'m sorry but we got you, man. Come on, it\\'s the end of the line, pal. There\\'s nowhere to hide.  Just pull off that band-aid. You lost. it\\'s okay. Dammit, Scotty! Reduce yourself! Magic? Dammit. Get to Lang\\'s. Now. Well done, Honey. Let\\'s go! - Leave me here. - We can make it. You said it yourself. I\\'ve hurt people. But you haven\\'t. - Go, please. - We can make it, Ava. Bill... I\\'m not leaving you. Oh, hey guys. Are my two years up already? What\\'s it like out there? I mean... Do people still dance? Are food trucks still a thing? You got away with it this time, Scott, but... I\\'ll be seeing you again. Where? Huh? Where will you be seeing me again? Like... in general, I\\'ll see you. Like, the next time you do something bad. - I\\'ll be there. To catch you. - Ohh. You\\'ll be watching me. I thought you were inviting me somewhere. Why would I do that? That\\'s what I was wondering. Why would you do that either? Like a party, or dinner or something? I don\\'t know. I thought you were planning the evening. No. I meant to, like, arrest you. Like, I\\'ll arrest you later again. - Take it easy. - Okay. Did you wanna go out tonight or something? I mean, \\'cause I\\'m free. Yeah. Come on. - You ready? - Yes! - Daddy! - Hi! Yes, that was a... - 8:30, Monday. - Sounds great. Mr. Karapetyan? Yeah, you saw that? Well, it would be an honor to be in business with you as well. I\\'ll see you Thursday, 9 A.M. Okay. This is awesome. So, Cassie... What do you wanna be when you grow up? I wanna help people. Like my Dad. Really? I wanted to be his partner. But he said he wants you. Is that so? Daddy! Hold on. - Move! Get outta here! - No. Don\\'t. Don\\'t! Oh! Gross. Ugh. I hate that moth dust. Go. Shoo! Shoo! subbed by: iamdepressed '],\n",
       " 'Captain Marvel': ['Do you know what time it is? Can\\'t sleep. There are tabs for that. Yeah, but then I\\'d be sleeping. Dreams again. Want to fight? - I slipped. - Right. You slipped. As a result of me punching you in the face. I was already slipping when you happened to punch me in the face. But you most probably did. Tell me about this dream. Anything new? No. You have to let go of the past. Can\\'t remember my past. It\\'s causing you doubt. And doubt makes you vulnerable. Control it. Learn to control again. You\\'ll have to commune with the Supreme Intelligence. There\\'s nothing more dangerous to a warrior than emotion. Humor is a distraction. Anger... anger represents the enemy. 120 days since the last Skrull attack. Has anyone ever seen what the Supreme Intelligence really looks like? No one can look upon the Supreme Intelligence in its true form. You know that. Our subconcious chooses the way they appear to us, so it\\'s sacred. It\\'s personal. No Kree divulges it. Ever. Who do you see? - Your brother. - No. - Father. - No. - Your old commander. - Vers. It\\'s me you see, isn\\'t it? I see what you\\'re trying to do. - Is it working? - Yes. But you won\\'t succeed in changing the subject. What is the point of giving me these if you don\\'t want me to use them? I want you to use them. The Supreme Intelligence gave me responsibility of showing you how to use them. I know how. Well if that were true, you could\\'ve knocked me down without it. Control your impulses. Stop using this, and start using this. I want you... to be the best version of yourself. Vers. Intelligence. Your commander insists that you\\'re fit to serve. I am. You struggle with your emotions. With your past, what fuels them. You are just one victim of the Skrull expansion that has threatened our civilization for centuries. Imposters who silently infiltrate, then take over our planets. Horrors that you remember, and so much that you do not. It\\'s all blank... My life. You\\'re supposed to take the form of who I used to admire, but I don\\'t even remember who this person was to me. Perhaps, this is a mercy. Sparing you from a deeper pain. Freeing you to do what all Kree must. Put your people\\'s needs before your own. We\\'ve given you a great gift. The chance to fight for the good of all Kree. I want to serve. Then master yourself. What was given can be taken away. I won\\'t let you down. We\\'ll know soon enough. You have a mission. Serve well and with honor. This can\\'t be good. Must be another Skrull attack. Whatever it is, it\\'s big. - Has a Skrull ever simmed you? - Once. - It was deeeply disturbing. - Why? Because I stared into the face of my mortal enemy and the face staring back was my own. Maybe if you were more attractive, then it would be less disturbing. You think you\\'re funny. I\\'m not laughing. - You never laugh. - I laugh. On the inside. I\\'m not doing it now. It\\'s funny, \\'cause objectively speaking, you\\'re quite handsome. Well, thank you. Listen up, team. Knock it off. Right. Prepare for... A search and rescue of our spy, Soh-Larr. The Skrulls have invaded yet another border planet. This time, Torfa. Soh-Larr sent us a warning signal. It was intercepted, and his cover\\'s blown. The Skrull general Talos has sent kill units to find him. Should they reach him before we do, the intelligence he\\'s acquired over three years is as good as theirs. The Accusers will bomb a Skrull stronghold here in the south. We slip in, we locate Soh-Larr, and we get out. Leaving them none the wiser. The Torfan populace, we are not to interfere with them, nor them with us. Nothing compromises the security of our mission. Proceed with caution. Follow protocol before extracting him. This is a dangerous mission. We must all be ready to join the Collective... if that is our fate today. - For the good of all Kree. - For the good of all Kree! Vers, track Soh-Larr\\'s beacon. Att-Lass, Minn-Erva, find elevation. Locals on the periphery. - Maybe a dozen. - Minn-Erva? Do you read me? Anybody copy? His beacon\\'s coming from that temple. Let\\'s move. No. This is a perfect spot for an ambush. - Only one way in and one way out. - We can get past the locals. We don\\'t know if they are locals. Too risky. You don\\'t have to go with me. I\\'ll go alone. No, you won\\'t. Right. We keep a close radius. We lose comms, we meet back in here. Come on. - Att-Lass, you getting this? - Copy. I see them. Minn-Erva, do you have eyes on us? - Keep them back. Minn-Erva? - Does anybody copy? I don\\'t wanna hurt you. Keep back! Stand back! They\\'re locals. I found two dead. No green. They\\'re just starving. - HGX-78. - 2RT-79. 8XX. Get back. Skrulls! Vers! Vers... it\\'s an ambush... Incoming! Talk to me. Do you copy? How did you know the code? How about I tell you my secret... ...when you tell me yours. Let\\'s open her up. - Where are we? - Standby. Where\\'s your head at? In the clouds. Where\\'s yours? On my shoulders. About to show these boys how we do it. You ready? - Higher, further, faster, baby. - That\\'s right. This can\\'t be right. Go back even further. You\\'re too fast! You need to go slow! Now who is this person? Are--- are we in the right... What the hell are you thinking? You don\\'t belong out here! I think we went back too far. You won\\'t let me drive. Let me try it back. What the hell is wrong with her? You\\'ll kill yourself. They\\'ll never let you fly. I am not the only one who\\'s confused here. You\\'re a decent pilot, but you\\'re too emotional. You do know why they call it a \"cockpit\", don\\'t you? ...Huge rubble, throughout the cosmos... ...shift the moon and the sun and the stars in the sky. And soon, they\\'ll wile away. Flew out throughout the night. Did you see it? Get your butts inside, it\\'s time to eat. Prepare for take-off, Lt. Trouble. Charming memory. Hang on. I think I got it. Goose likes you. She doesn\\'t typically take to people. - Early start to your morning? - Late night, actually. I can\\'t sleep when there\\'s work to do. Sound familiar? Flying airplanes never feels like work. - Wonderful view, isn\\'t it? - I prefer the view from up there. You\\'ll get there soon enough, ace. Wait, wait, wait, that\\'s her. - Get her back. - Standby. ...sound familiar... Wonderful view, isn\\'t it? - i prefer the view from up there. - You\\'ll get there soon enough... What\\'s that on her shirt? I couldn\\'t read it. Wonderful view, isn\\'t it? - I prefer the view from up there. - You\\'ll get there soon enough... Focus... Look down. Focus. Pegasus... Dr. Wendy Lawson. That\\'s her. - Do you hear that, too? - Now track the location. Got it. Now track Lawson until we find the energy signature. Interesting. Hold on... - Go back right before this. - Okay. Now let\\'s see where you\\'re headed. That\\'s right. Look at the coordinates... Focus. That\\'s it. That\\'s it. Almost there... You\\'re almost there. Don\\'t fight it. Focus! Focus! Get her back! Get her back now. Do we have any information we can act on? Just that Lawson was somewhere on planet C-53. We\\'re on our way. Then dig, dig, dig, deeper. Lawson is our link to that lightspeed engine. And everything we\\'re after. That did something. Try that again? Not yet! What did you do to me? We\\'re just after little information. - What did you put in my head? - Nothing that wasn\\'t already there. But those aren\\'t my memories. Yeah, it\\'s like a bad trip in there. I\\'m not surprised you can\\'t keep it straight. They really did a number on you. Enough of your mindgames. What do you want? We\\'re looking for the location of a Dr. Lawson and her lightspeed engine. I don\\'t know any Dr. Lawson. Then why is she in your head? Either of you wouldn\\'t happen to know how these things come off, would you? No? Fine. Hey. You do know why they call it co... Leaving so soon? We just got to know each other. Vers to Starforce Command. Do you read me? Hello? Do you copy? Hi. I\\'m Vers. Kree Starforce. Is this C-53? Do you understand me? Is my universal translator working? Yeah. I understand you. Good. Are you in charge of security for this district? Sort of.... The movie theater has its own guy. Where can I find communication equipment? Thank you. Track the pod and find the girl. She knows more than she knows. Hey! This one\\'s taken. Come on... Vers... - Clarify: CQC-39. - GRX8-1600. And I\\'m fine, thank you for asking. - Is everyone okay? What happened? - Skrull ambush. I thought we\\'d lost you. - Did you find Soh-Larr? - It wasn\\'t Soh-Larr. Talos simmed him. Even knew his code. That\\'s impossible. That code was buried in his unconscious. The Skrulls messed with my mind. The machine that they used, I think it\\'s how they extracted Soh-Larr\\'s code. - Vers, where are you? - I\\'m on Planet C-53. The Skrulls are looking for someone named Lawson. Who? She\\'s who I see... She\\'s what? Vers. Vers, what? She\\'s a scientist. They think that she\\'s cracked the code on lightspeed tech. I have to get to her before they do or else they\\'ll be able to invade galaxies. No. You\\'ve been caught once already. How far is C-53? Closest jump point is 22 hours. Vers, hold your position until we get there. Keep your comms online so we can contact... No. What if they get a hold of it before... Vers. Vers. Vers! If the Skrulls got to her, she\\'s compromised. She\\'s stronger than you think. Ever been to C-53? Once. It\\'s a real shithole. You called this in? Beacon activated. Excuse me, Miss. Did you know anything about a lady blowing a hole through the roof of that Blockbuster over there? Witness says she looks dressed for laser tag. Yeah, I think she went that way. Uhh, I\\'d like to ask you some questions. Maybe give you the 411 on the late-night drive-bys. How do we know... you\\'re not one of those shapeshifters? Congratulations, Agent Fury. You have finally asked a relevant question. No. Congratulations to you, Starforce lady! You\\'re under arrest. Rook! Rook! Let\\'s roll! - Did you see her weapon? - I did not. Suspect on northbound train. In pursuit. \"Trust me, true believer. Trust me...\" \"Trust me, true believer...\" Train\\'s headed to a tunnel up ahead. Let\\'s greet them at the station. Agent Fury, this is Agent Coulson. Umm.. Uh, I\\'m still here at the Blockbuster, and uh... Where\\'d everybody go? I finished collecting evidence... Official SHIELD activity. Stay back. Nice scuba suit. Lighten up, honey, huh? Gonna smile for me? All life on Earth is carbon-based. Not this guy. Whatever he runs on, it\\'s not on the periodic table. So you\\'re saying he\\'s not from around here? Hey, how\\'s your eye? Well, I\\'d say fine. But it can\\'t believe what it\\'s seeing. You said... this thing looked like Coulson? Mmm. Talked like him, too. And the woman said that there were more? The word she used was infiltration. - You believe her? - Not til I saw this. What\\'s your plan? I\\'ll find the Blockbuster girl. I got word on a motorcycle thief that fits her description. If she can tell us why these lizards are here... Maybe she can tell us how to kick \\'em to the curb. Good. Do it alone, though. You can\\'t trust anyone. - Not even our own men. - Yes, sir. Wow. They\\'re ugly bastards, aren\\'t they? Yeah, well. He\\'s no Brad Pitt, sir. Safe journey to the beyond, my friend. I will finish what we started. I wouldn\\'t get too close there, boss. No one in or out. - What can I get you? - Where was this photograph taken? - Airport? - Where\\'s Pegasus? That\\'s classified. Not unlike the file I\\'ve started on you. I see you\\'ve changed it up a bit since then. Grunge is a good look for you. - Did you have a rough day, Agent Fury? - It\\'s cool. You know, had a space invasion, big car chase... Got to watch an alien autopsy... - Typical 9 to 5. - So you saw one. I was never one to believe in aliens... ...but I can\\'t unsee that. This is gonna get a little awkward, but I gotta ask... You think I\\'m one of those green things. Can\\'t be too careful. You, are looking at 100% red-blooded Earthman. I\\'m afraid I\\'m gonna need proof. - We talking cheek swab or urine sample? - No. The DNA would match. Want my AOL password? Skrulls can only sim recent memories of their hosts\\' bodies. You wanna get personal. - Where were you born? - Huntsville, Alabama. But technically I don\\'t remember that part. - Name of your first pet? - Mr. Snoofers. - Mr. Snoofers? - That\\'s what I said. Do I pass? - Not yet. First job? - Soldier. Straight outta high school. Left the ranks a full-bird colonel. - Then? - Spy. - Where? - It\\'s the Cold War. We were everywhere. Belfast, Bucharest, Belgrade, Budapest. I like the B\\'s. I can make \\'em rhyme. Now? Been riding a desk for the past six years trying to figure out where our future enemies are coming from. Never occured to me they would be coming from above. Name a detail so bizarre, a Skrull could never fabricate it. If toast is cut diagonally, I can\\'t eat it. You didn\\'t need that, did you? No. No, I didn\\'t. But I enjoyed it. Okay. Your turn. Prove you\\'re not a Skrull. And how is that suppposed to prove to me you\\'re not a Skrull? That\\'s a photon blast. - And? - A Skrull can\\'t do that. So, a full-bird colonel turned spy turned SHIELD Agent. Must have pretty high security clearance. Where\\'s Pegasus? Okay. The Skrulls sim alien races to infiltrate and take over planets... and you\\'re a Kree. - A race of noble warriors. - Heroes. Noble warrior heroes. So, what do Skrulls want with Dr. Lawson? They believe that she developed a lightspeed engine at Pegasus. Lightspeed engine? Gotta admit, that\\'s not the craziest thing I\\'ve heard today. Well, it\\'s still early. And you? What do you want? To stop the Skrulls before they become unstoppable. And? Look, war is a universal language. I know a rogue soldier when I see one. You got a personal stake in this. This is government property. Turn your vehicle around. Nicholas Joseph Fury. Agent of SHIELD. Place your thumb on the pad. One moment. Nicholas Joseph Fury? You have three names? Everybody calls me Fury. Not Nicholas, not Joseph, not Nick. Just Fury. - What does your Mom call you? - Fury. - What do you call her? - Fury. - What about your kids? - If I had them... - they\\'ll call me Fury. - You\\'re cleared for access. Thank you. Oh, hold up. You look like somebody\\'s disaffected niece. Put that on. - What is it? - It\\'s the SHIELD logo. Does announcing your identity on clothing help with the covert part of your job? Said the space soldier who was wearing a rubber suit. Lose the flannel. How can I help you? We\\'re Agents of SHIELD. We\\'re looking for a woman named Lawson. Dr. Wendy Lawson. Do you know her? Follow me. You familiar with the phrase \\'welcome wagon\\'? No. Well this ain\\'t it. - Is that a communicator? - Yeah. State-of-the-art two-way pager. - Who are you paging? - My Mom. Don\\'t worry. I didn\\'t mention you. DETAINED WITH TARGET. NEED BACKUP After you. Impressive. You should see what I can do with a paperclip. Hey, how are you, huh? Look at you. Just look at you! Aren\\'t you the cutest little thing? Aren\\'t you cute? What\\'s your name, huh? What\\'s your name? \"Goose\". Cool name for a cool cat. Fury? I\\'ll be back. Hold up. Lemme get my fingerprint out. Just let me unravel this... You sat there, and watched me play with tape, when all you had to do was... I didn\\'t want to steal your thunder. Lawson. Lawson\\'s plan for the lightspeed engine. I wonder why they terminated the project. Maybe because she\\'s.... coo-coo. - Kree glyphs? - Huh? Lawson is not coo-coo. She\\'s Kree. - Well... she\\'s dead. - What? She crashed an Aces aircraft during an unauthorized test flight. Took a pilot down with her. That\\'s why security here\\'s so friendly. They\\'re covering up a billion-dollar mistake. Oh. And your lightspeed engine? It\\'s toast. - When did this crash happen? - Six years ago. 1989. Who was the pilot? Most of this thing\\'s redacted, but... there is a testimonial here from a Maria Rambeau. Last person to see them alive. Back in a few. This isn\\'t about fighting wars. It\\'s about ending them. I know Lawson was Kree. She was here on C-53 and died in a plane crash. Do you know anything about this? I just discovered a mission report sent from C-53. There\\'s only so much I\\'m cleared to tell you, Vers. But... Lawson, was an undercover Kree operative named Mar-Vell. She was working on a unique energy core... Experimenting with tech that apparently, could help us win the war. She still here? She\\'s cooperating with the investigation, sir. - You men, stay here. - Yes, sir. I want to question her alone. Excellent work, Nicholas. Does it say anything about me? Anything about you? No, of course, not. Why would it? I found evidence that I... had a life here. On C-53? Mar-Vell is who I see when I visit the Supreme Intelligence. I knew her. And I knew her as Lawson. This sounds like Skrull simulation, Vers. No, it\\'s not because I remember. I was here... Stop. Remember your training. Know your enemy. It could be you. Do not let your emotions override your judgment. She\\'s on sub-level 6. I\\'ll get off on 5, hit the stairs in case she makes a run for it. Do a pincer move. Like we did in Havana. Right. Like we did in Havana. We\\'re nearing the jump point. Leave your beacon on so I can find you. We\\'ll get to the bottom of this, Vers. Together. Okay. Vers! Vers! Fury\\'s colluding with the target. Then why would he call us in? All I know is we take him in, too. Dead or alive. Dead or alive? Go! Go, go! Was it something I said? Now, you know, I don\\'t really need these to see. But... They do kinda complete the look. Don\\'t you think? - You called it in? - My bad! - Coulson! You have eyes on them? - They\\'re not down here. Let\\'s try up there. What? Your communicator. You obviously can\\'t be trusted with it. Do you know how to fly this thing? Uhh, we\\'ll see. That\\'s a \\'yes or no\\' question. Yes. That\\'s what I\\'m talking about. We got a stowaway. Hang on, Goose. Goose. Who\\'s a good kitty, huh? Huh, Goose? Yes, that\\'s right. Who\\'s a good kitty, Goose? - You the good kitty. - See anyone you know? Funny story... I arrived on Hala, near dead, no memory... That was six years ago. So you think, you\\'re the pilot that went down with Dr. Lawson? I\\'m saying the last person to see them alive could probably tell us. - Maria Rambeau. - So how do we get to Louisiana? Due east. Hang a right at Memphis. That agent... That stopped the Skrulls from finding us... Coulson. The new guy. - I guess he doesn\\'t hate me yet. - Yeah, well. Give him time. I guess he had a feeling, you know. Went with his gut against orders. It\\'s a really hard thing to do. That\\'s what keeps us human. I get in trouble for that. A lot. I see that about you. Rescuing the guy who sold you out to the Skrulls? I\\'m guessing that\\'s not standard Kree operating procedure. Well, I won\\'t tell your boss if you don\\'t tell mine. Ronan. The Accusers completed their operation, but the greater mission was a failure thanks to your team. It was a trap. To lure our operative Vers to talk for her kidnapper. Give us the location. We\\'ll take care of the terrorist threat. By bombing them out of the galaxy. No. - We\\'ll handle this. - Several Skrulls anywhere... is a threat to Kree everywhere. Where are they? - They are... - Lost. They are lost, for now. But we will find them. Do so. Or we will. Maintain the course for C-53. Excuse me, I\\'m looking for Maria Rambeau? Auntie Carol? Mom, it\\'s Auntie Carol! I knew it! Everyone said you were dead. But we knew they were lying. I\\'m not really who you think I am. - That is the craziest shit I ever heard. - Green, transforming aliens? - There\\'s no such thing. - You\\'re absolutely right, young lady. There is no such thing. \\'Cause if there were... We would wanna keep that to ourselves. You don\\'t believe me? No way. That\\'s so cool. She can do a lot more than make tea with those hands. - Like what? Show us. - Maybe later. I kept all your stuff. I\\'ll go get it. You wanna give her a hand with that? You don\\'t remember anything? I can see... ...flashes... Little moments. But I can\\'t tell what\\'s real. If I could just piece together what happened that morning... Maybe it\\'ll make sense. You woke me up, banging on my door at dawn. Your usual move. Back then we had to get up so early. The Air Force still wasn\\'t letting women fly combat, so... testing Lawson\\'s plane was our only shot at doing something that mattered. And you wanted to race to the base, in your old Mustang, and I wasn\\'t about to argue, \\'cause I knew my Camaro would dominate. But you cheated. Took a shortcut. Since when is a shortcut cheating? Since it violates the predetermined rules of engagement. - I definitely don\\'t remember those. - Of course, you don\\'t. When I got to the hangar... Lawson was agitated. She said she had lives to save. She was trying to take the Aces up herself, but you said... \"If there were lives at stake... I would fly the plane.\" Yup. Big hero moment. The kind of moment we\\'ve both been waiting for. The Doc was always unique. That\\'s why I liked her, but... Now you\\'re saying she\\'s... from another planet. - I know this must be hard for you. - What, this part right here? No. No. Mmm-mm. Know what\\'s hard? It is losing my best friend in a mission so secret, they act like it never even happened. Hard... is knowing you were out there somewhere, too damn stubborn to die. And now you come up in here after 6 years... With your super-charged fire-hands and you expect me to call you... I don\\'t even know what... \"Vers\"? Is that really who you are now? I don\\'t know. Come look. This is me and you on Halloween. I\\'m Amelia Earhart, and you\\'re Janis Joplin. This is you when you were little. You didn\\'t get along with your parents, so Mom said we became your real family. This is us on Christmas. I got more... Here\\'s another picture of you when you were little. And this is how you actually graduated... Oh, wait. I forgot, your jacket. Mom doesn\\'t let me wear it anymore after I spilled ketchup on it. That was all that survived the crash. Or so we thought. Don\\'t answer that. It\\'s just my neighbor. They can change into anyone. Hi, there. What do you want? Hey, Tom. This is my friend, Carol. Pleased to meet you! Yow! Static electricity out here\\'s no joke. I noticed that peculiar bird you got parked by the road, and I was just wondering if you\\'d mind if I bring the boys over to get a closer looksie? - A closer looksie? - Yeah. To see the bird parked out by the road. You\\'re really working overtime to sell this one, aren\\'t you... Talos? I\\'m sorry, Tom. This isn\\'t a good time. I\\'ll come by tomorrow? Okay? You know, you really should be kinder to your neighbors. You never know when you\\'re gonna need to borrow some sugar. Hang on a second. Before you go swinging those jazz-hands around, making a mess in your friend\\'s house, - and... it\\'s a lovely home. - Oh, my God... What the hell?! No one\\'s gonna hurt the girl. Just, don\\'t kill me. It would really complicate the situation. I\\'m about 5 seconds from complicating that wall with some ugly-ass Skrull brains. I\\'m sorry I simmed your boss. But now I stand before you as my true self. - Without deception. - And who\\'s that out there? Okay. That\\'s a fair point. But I\\'m sure that you understand, I had to take some precautions. I saw you crush 20 of my best men with your hands bound. I just wanna talk. The last time we talked, I ended up hanging from my ankles. That was before I knew who you were. Before I knew what made you different from the others. I have an audio recording from Pegasus, of your voice, from a plane crash, six years ago. On a device I believe you call a \"black box\". They told me it was destroyed in the crash. How\\'d you get it? Does she not understand? Young lady I have a special skill that kinda allows me to get into places I\\'m not supposed to be in. Call me young lady again, and I\\'m gonna put my foot in a place it\\'s not supposed to be. Am I supposed to guess, where that is? - Your ass. - Your ass. Okay, I get it. We\\'re all a little on edge here. But look, I just need your help decoding some coordinates. If you sit down, you listen to this, I assure you, it\\'ll be worth your while. Call your buddy back inside and I\\'ll listen. Deal. Oh, my God! Get that thing away! How\\'d that get in here? The cat? This isn\\'t what you\\'re afraid of, is it? That\\'s not a cat. That\\'s a Flerken. - A Flerken? - Mom? - Monica... - Why can\\'t I listen too? What\\'s happening? It\\'s loading. Punch in the coordinates: 5229, -47, 8.768, 0.2. Copy that. Where are we going, Doc? - My laboratory. - Your laboratory? - What do you mean? - Oh, no. Is that... Wait, what is that? It\\'s not showing up on my radar. Go, Carol. Fly! That\\'s no MIG, Lawson. - Who the hell are they? - Those are the bad guys. - Fly faster, now. - Yes, ma\\'am. - What do they want? - Me. My work. I never should have brought you along. Here comes some G\\'s. They\\'re firing backwards. Hold on! Bail out! Bail out! Bail out! Stay with me, Lawson! Danvers, do you copy? Yeah, I copy. On the ground. - Can anyone hear me? - Yeah. I copy. Doc? Your blood... it\\'s blue. Never mind that. How\\'s my hair? Help me out, will you? - I have to destroy it before they get here. - What? Lawson? You remember what I said about our work here? What it\\'s for? - To end wars? - Yeah. But the wars are bigger than you know. Damn it! My name is not Lawson. My real name, is Mar-Vell... We have no interest in hurting you. No?! Because all the shooting kinda gave me the wrong impression! The energy core... Where is it? Pararescue\\'s on the way. You have two minutes until you\\'re surrounded. Then I see no reason to prolong this conversation. No, wait! You mean that energy core? Commander. She\\'s still moving. - Permission to fire. - Hold your fire. There\\'s nothing left. The core has been destroyed. \"VERS\" She absorbed its\\' power. She\\'s coming with us. He lied to me. - Everything that I knew was a lie. - Now... - ...you understand. - What? What do I understand now? Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell. He killed her. Because she found out that she was on the wrong side of an unjust war. No. Your people are terrorists... that kill innocents. I saw the ruins on Torfa. Ruins that the Accusers are responsible for. My people lived as refugees, on Torfa. Homeless, ever since we resisted Kree rule, and they destroyed our planet. Now the handful of us that are left, will be slaughtered next. Unless, you will help me finish what Mar-Vell started. The coordinates you found, would\\'ve powered a lightspeed ship capable of carrying us to safety. A new home. Where the Kree can\\'t reach us. Lawson always told us that her work at Pegasus wasn\\'t to fight wars... But to end them. She wanted you to help us find the core. Well, I already destroyed it. No, you destroyed the engine. The core that powered it is in a remote location. If you help us decode those coordinates... We can find it. You\\'ll use it to destroy us. We just want a home. You and I lost everything at the hands of the Kree. Can\\'t you see it now? You\\'re not one of them. You don\\'t know me. You have no idea who I am. I don\\'t even know who I am. You are Carol Danvers. You are the woman on that black box risking her life to do the right thing. My best friend... who supported me as a mother, and a pilot when no one else did. You\\'re smart, and funny, and a huge pain in the ass. And you are the most powerful person I knew. Way before you could shoot fire from your fist. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? I know I don\\'t deserve your trust, but... you were our only lead. We discovered that your energy signature matched Mar-Vell\\'s core. Now, we know why. If only you knew, the importance of it to me. I just need your help decoding the coordinates to Mar-Vell\\'s lab. Those weren\\'t coordinates. They\\'re safe vectors. Orbital positioning and velocity. You didn\\'t find her lab on Earth, because it\\'s not on Earth. That was the location on the day of the crash six years ago. If we track its course, we\\'ll find it, in orbit, right now. It\\'s just basic physics. In orbit? Was that so difficult to figure out? I mean, you\\'re my science guy, right? Yon-Rogg will catch up to us soon. We\\'ve got to get to the core before he does. You\\'re going to space? In what? A few tweaks to your vessel should do it. I can handle the modifications. Hmm. Your science guy. Well, I could use a co-pilot. No. No, I... I can\\'t. - I can\\'t leave Monica. - Why? It\\'s okay. I can stay with grandma and poppop. There\\'s no way I\\'m going baby. It\\'s too dangerous. Testing for new aerospace tech is dangerous. Didn\\'t you used to do that? Your plan is to leave the atmosphere in a craft not designed for the journey, and you anticipate hostile encounters with a technologically superior foreign enemy. Correct? - That\\'s what I\\'m saying. You have to go. - Monica... You will just fly the coolest mission in the history of missions. And you\\'re gonna give it up to sit on the couch and watch Fresh Prince with me? I just think you should consider what kind of example you\\'re setting for your daughter. Your Mom\\'s lucky. When they were handing out kids, they gave her the toughest one. Lieutenant Trouble. You remember. Is that mine? Oh, no. You hang on to it until I come back. But there is something that I need your help with. I can\\'t wear these Kree colors anymore. And since you\\'re obviously the only person around here with any sense of style... Whoa. No. Uh-uhh. Definitely not. Well, since we\\'re on the same team... How do I look? Fresh. What took you so long? I\\'m fine, thanks for asking. - PRY46-- - Enough with codes. The system is fallible as we\\'ve learned. Okay. Then let\\'s do this. Who do I see, when I commune with the Supreme Intelligence? A person you most admire and respect, I guess. But you would never tell me who. And what is your earliest memory of Hala? A transfusion. Blue blood running through my veins. Whose blood? That\\'s my blood, that\\'s coursing through her veins. - What have you done to her? - You\\'re too late. She knows? Ronan. Skrulls have infiltrated C-53. Come at once. For the good of all Kree, Commander. The infestation will be eradicated. Passing 500 and climbing. You know, you really shouldn\\'t have that thing on your lap. My alliance with you, it\\'s tenuous at best. But as long as he continues to freak you out... Can I ask you something? You just turn into anything you want? - Well, I have to see it first. - Can you all do it? Physiologically, yeah. But... It takes practice, and dare I say it, talent to do what... Can you turn into a cat? What\\'s a cat? What about a filing cabinet? Why would I turn into a filing cabinet...? A venus fly trap. I\\'ll give you $50 right now if you turn into a venus fly trap. Switching engines from scramjet to fusion. Buckle up, folks. - Is this normal, like space turbulence? - Pretty much. Locking in a coordinate grid. Where is it? It\\'s here. It\\'s gotta be here. Well, is it in front.... of all that nothing, or behind it? Decloaking activated. Is that it? The core? In her notes, she called it the Tesseract. What was Lawson doing with all this kid stuff? We\\'re not alone. Talos! He didn\\'t come here for the Tesseract. We didn\\'t know what to do. Mar-Vell warned us not to send a signal for any reason. - Or the Kree would find us. - You did the right thing. It\\'s okay. It\\'s okay. She\\'s alright. She\\'s a friend. I am not gonna hurt you. She led me to you. I\\'m so sorry. I didn\\'t know. Carol... this is war. My hands are filthy from it, too. But we\\'re here now. You found my family. This is just the beginning. There\\'s thousands of us separated from each other. Scattered throughout the galaxy. If I played the same pinball machine for 6 years, I\\'d have some high scores, too. Fraternizing with the enemy. Uh-uh. What did you do to your uniform? They got in her head. Just like we thought. The Supreme Intelligence will set her straight. You can see they\\'re not soldiers. Let them go. - You can have me. - And the core? You lied to me. I made you a better version of yourself. What\\'s given can be taken away. There she is. Seems like your time on C-53 jogged the old memory. This jacket? It\\'s killer, by the way. The music, it\\'s a nice touch. - Let... me... out. - No can do. If you hurt them, I will burn you to the ground. With what, exactly? - Your power comes from us. - You didn\\'t give me these powers. The blast did. And yet, you\\'ve never had the strength to control them on your own. Species: Flerken. Threat: High. It\\'s a cat. Not Hannibal Lecter. Species: Human male. Threat: Low to none. That thing is clearly busted. Load the Flerken on the heli. Eject the others into space. You did good, ace. Thanks to you, those insidious shapeshifters will threaten our borders no more. I used to believe your lies. But the Skrulls are just fighting for a home. You\\'re talking about destroying them because they won\\'t submit to your rule. And neither will I. We found you. - We embraced you as our own. - You stole me. From my home. My family, my friends. It\\'s cute how hard you try. Remember... Without us... Give it up, Carol! ... you\\'re weak. You\\'re flawed. Helpless. We saved you. Without us... you\\'re only human. You\\'re right. I\\'m only human. On Hala, you were reborn. Vers. My name... is Carol. She\\'s trying to break out. I\\'ve been fighting with one arm tied behind my back. But what happens when... ... I\\'m finally set free? You, know you\\'re glowing, right? I\\'ll explain it later. Take the Tesseract. Leave the lunchbox. - Me? - Yes. - I\\'m not touching that thing. - Want me to get you an oven mitt? Get the Skrulls in the QuadJet and go. Take the Flerken with you. - What about you? - I\\'ll buy you some time. I\\'m picking you up now. I\\'m trusting you not to eat me. Hey, guys. Arm-wrestle for the Tesseract? I used to find you amusing. Let\\'s put an end to this! Okay! Good kitty! You knew all along. Is that why we never hung out? No. I just never liked you. Hey! In a hurry? - Don\\'t make me do this. - Okay. Now! Come on! Do your thing. Come on! Dammit, Goose. Pick a side. Take them to the hangar too. We\\'ll blast them all into space. Play it cool. Just like Havana. - Do you have the thing? - The Flerken kitty ate it. Come on. Move. Move! Follow my lead. Cover her eyes. Get on the ship. Let\\'s go, let\\'s go. Nice diversion. I could\\'ve swore, I put it in there. - Minn-Erva, take them down in a dropship. - On it. You all right, friend? Never... better. We\\'ve got a bogey. Coming in hot. Yes! What the hell was that? Deploy ballistic warheads. That\\'s impossible. C-53 doesn\\'t have a defense system advanced enough to destroy our warheads. That\\'s not their defense system, Ronan. Take her down. Return to the jump point. We\\'ll be back for the weapon. The core? The woman. I\\'m so proud of you. You\\'ve come a long way since I found you that day by the lake. But can you keep your emotions in check long enough to take me on? Or will it get the better of you, as always? I always told you... you\\'ll be ready, the day you can knock me down as yourself. This is that moment. This is that moment, Vers! Turn off the light show, and prove, prove to me, you can beat me with... I have nothing to prove to you. Destination: Hala. - I can\\'t go back empty-handed. - You won\\'t be empty-handed. I\\'m sending you with a message. Tell the Supreme Intelligence that I\\'m coming to end it. The war, the lies, all of it. You can\\'t do this. That was a close call, huh, Goosey? Huh? The bad guy\\'s still in there somewhere--- Oh! Mother Flerken! - You okay? - Yeah. It\\'s just a scratch. No... I can\\'t believe you got into the raddest dogfight ever. I\\'d say you arrived just in time. That\\'s some nifty flying you did out there. SHIELD could always use a good pilot like you. I\\'ll consider it. As long as you don\\'t call my flying nifty again. How\\'s your eye? Getting better every second. Just so I\\'m clear, you were Soh-Larr, and the SHIELD agent? Keller. Tied my boss up, stole his identity. I borrowed his likeness. I\\'m no thief. It\\'s a little like thief. Whose side are you on? You\\'re good to go here til you recover, but you and your family will need a new look. - I could go back to being your boss. - Please don\\'t. Come on. I love sporting his beautiful blue eyes. No way, you guys have the best eyes. Don\\'t ever change your eyes. I\\'ll help you find a home. Finish what Mar-Vell started. They can stay here with us, can\\'t they, Mom? They won\\'t be safe here, baby. Auntie Carol is right. They need their own home. I\\'ll be back before you know it. Maybe I can fly up and meet you halfway. Only if you learn to glow, like your Auntie Carol. Or maybe I\\'ll build a spaceship. You don\\'t know. He doesn\\'t. Keep the Tesseract on Earth. Hidden. You\\'re sure that\\'s what Marvel would want? - Mar-Vell. - That\\'s what I said. It\\'s two words. Mar-Vell. Mar-Vell. Marvel sounds a lot better. You know, like the Marvelettes? Not ringing any bells? Keep singing. Maybe it\\'ll come back to me. I upgraded it. Range should be, a couple galaxies, at least. What? You think I\\'m gonna crank call you? For emergencies only. Okay? Well, if you\\'re ever passing back through this galaxy, be sure to give a brother a shout. We got the ketchup stain off. Thanks, Lt. Trouble. It\\'s hard for me to say goodbye, too. Go on. Glad to have you back, sir. This came for you. So, is it true? That the Kree burned your eye out because you refused to give them the Tesseract? I\\'ll neither confirm nor deny the facts of that story. Understood. I\\'m sorry to report that we still haven\\'t found the Tesseract. I\\'m sure it will turn up somewhere. I\\'ll let you know when it does. Then what? Sir? We have no idea what other intergalactic threats are out there. And our one-woman security force had a prior commitment on the other side of the universe. SHIELD alone can\\'t protect us. We need to find more. - More weapons? - More heroes. You think we can find others like her? We found her and we weren\\'t even looking. Get some rest, sir. You got a big decision to make.'],\n",
       " 'Spider-Man Far From Home': ['Nick, this was a tragedy, but it\\'s not why we\\'re here. What, are we fighting the weather now? Locals say the cyclone had a face. People see things when they\\'re under stress. That does not mean that this is the start to some other big world-ending Who are you? You don\\'t want any part of this. Gone but not forgotten. Thanks to Kenneth Lim and Vihaan Ramamurthy for their help with that touching video tribute. This year has been nothing short of ***. It is crazy. It\\'s insane. Jason. What? No swearing. It\\'s the last day of school. We\\'re good. Historic. Over five years ago, half of all life in the universe, including our own Midtown High, was wiped from existence. Then eight months ago, a band of brave heroes brought us back. They called it \"the Blip.\" Those of us who Blipped away came back the same age But our classmates that didn\\'t Blip had grown five years older. My little brother is now older than me. Yeah, it\\'s math. Even though we had Blipped away halfway through the school year and had already taken midterms, the school made us start the whole year over from the beginning. It\\'s totally unfair. It\\'s not right. Tigers, it\\'s been a long, dramatic, somewhat confusing road. As we draw this year to a close, it\\'s time to move on to a new phase of our lives. Pray nothing crazy happens again because are the Avengers even a thing anymore? Does anyone even have a plan? I have a plan. Okay, first, I\\'m gonna sit next to MJ on the flight. Second, I\\'m gonna buy a dual-headphone adapter and watch movies with her the whole time. Okay. Three, when we go to Venice Venice is famous for making stuff out of glass, right? True. So I\\'m gonna buy her a black dahlia necklace because her favorite flower is the black dahlia because of, well The murder. The murder. Four, when we go to Paris, I\\'m gonna take her to the top of the Eiffel Tower, give her the necklace. Then, five, I\\'m gonna tell her how I feel. Then, six, hopefully she tells me she feels the same way. Oh, don\\'t forget step seven. Step seven? Don\\'t do any of that. Why? We\\'re gonna be bachelors in Europe. Ned. Look, I may not know much, but I do know this: Europeans love Americans. Really? More than half of them are women. Okay. Sure. But I really like MJ, man, okay? She\\'s awesome, she\\'s super funny in a kind of dark way. Sometimes I catch her looking at me, I feel like I\\'ve stood up She\\'s coming. Don\\'t say anything. What up, dorks? Excited about the science trip? Hey, we\\'re talking about the trip. Yeah, and Peter\\'s plan. You have a plan? I don\\'t I don\\'t have a plan. No, he\\'s just gonna collect tiny spoons when we\\'re traveling to other countries. Like a grandmother? I\\'m not collecting tiny spoons. He\\'s collecting tiny spoons. Oh, okay, well that was a real roller coaster. By the way, travel tip: You should download a VPN on your phone, so the government can\\'t track you while we\\'re abroad. Smart. Will do. Dude, I think that went really great. When I Blipped back to my apartment, the family that was living there was very confused. The wife thought that I was a mistress. The grandma thought that I was a ghost. It was It was really a mess. Thank you for coming out to support those who have been displaced by the Blip. And, of course, thanks to our very own Spider-Man! Thank you, Miss Parker, for having me. And thank you, you guys, for having me. And thank you, Spider-Man. He\\'ll be right back out to take photos and videos. Thank you! That was amazing. That was great. That was so cool. I was so nervous. I was a little stiff. I wasn\\'t in the pocket.   I thought you did great. You were a little stiff. Yeah, I felt that too. I felt that too. It\\'s fine, it\\'s fine. Okay. Did you get your passport? Yeah. Mini toothpaste? Yeah, I did. Hey, sorry I\\'m late. Happy. Hey. Oh, you look lovely. Thanks. You too. Thank you. New dress? Yeah, yes, it is. It\\'s a new beard. It\\'s my My Blip beard. I grew it in the Blip. It\\'s a Blip beard. I see. Yeah. The reason I\\'m late is because this was misplaced at the office. Can you believe it? Because it\\'s enormous. Not the amount, the size. The amount\\'s nice too. They\\'re generous. Pepper said, sorry she couldn\\'t be here. Yeah. Thank you. I think I\\'m gonna go change the Sterno under the vegan lasagna. Spider-Man, go shake hands. Will do. What just happened? Heads up, Nick Fury\\'s calling you. Fury\\'s gonna call me? Why? Yeah. Why? He probably has hero stuff for you to do. You\\'re a superhero. He calls superheroes. If it was that important, he\\'d probably call someone else, not me. Apparently not. No caller ID. That\\'s him. I don\\'t wanna talk to Fury. Answer the phone. Why? If you don\\'t talk to him, I have to, and I don\\'t want to. Why not? Because I\\'m scared. Answer the phone. You sent Nick Fury to voicemail? Yeah. You don\\'t send Fury to voicemail. Hear that? They\\'re calling me. I gotta go. You gotta talk to him. I\\'m gonna call him. I promise you, I\\'m gonna call him. I will. You do not ghost Nick Fury. I promise you, I\\'ll call him. After my trip. Hey! Yeah, hi No, no, he\\'s not ghosting you. Okay, one question at a time. Are you the head Avenger? Are you the head Avenger now? No, I\\'m not. If the aliens come back, what are you gonna do? If the aliens come back, what will you do? Does anyone have any neighborhood questions? Sean Winford, Queens Tribune.  What it is like to take over from Tony Stark? Those are some big shoes to fill. I\\'m I\\'m gonna go. Thanks so much, everyone, for coming. Okay. Hungry? So sorry. I thought you could sense that with your Peter-tingle. Please do not start calling it my Peter-tingle. What\\'s up? You can dodge bullets but not bananas? No, I just really need this vacation. I need a break. You deserve it. Yeah. You know what? You should pack your suit, just in case. I have a tingle about it. Please stop saying \"tingle,\" May. No. No. No, I\\'m not. Yeah! Can you help me get my stuff up here? Oh, sorry, that\\'s mine. No worries. Middle seat gets both armrests. Give me a tablet. Do you want the first shift or the second? I could take either. Give me the third shift. I took an Ambien. I can\\'t chaperone these kids alone. Yo, Parker. This is called an airplane. It\\'s like the buses you\\'re used to, except it flies over the poor neighborhoods instead of driving through them. Ma\\'am? He Blipped, so technically, he\\'s 16, not 21. I\\'ll take that. She\\'s lying. I don\\'t even know this girl. Classic MJ, right? Did you know Brad was coming? It It\\'s so weird. One day, he\\'s that kid who cried and got nosebleeds all the time, and suddenly, we Blip back, and he\\'s totally ripped and super nice and all these girls are after him. Not all the girls are after him. No, man, they\\'re all after him. Yeah. Here. Anyway, on to more important things. It\\'s a nine-hour flight. We can play Beast Slayers the whole time. Are you excited? I need your help to sit next to MJ. Seriously? Yes, seriously. What about our plan? American bachelors in Europe. That\\'s your plan. That\\'s a solo plan. Come on, this is my plan. Please. Hey, guys. There\\'s an old lady in front of us wearing a crazy amount of perfume, and it\\'s kind of setting off Peter\\'s allergies.  Betty, if you could switch seats with him, that would be He\\'s allergic to perfume? Yeah, yeah, because it It makes his eyes water, and he can\\'t really Peter has a perfume allergy? From experience, perfume allergies are no joke. I can feel hives breaking out already. MJ, stand up. Ned, take MJ\\'s spot. MJ, you take my spot. Peter, let\\'s get you out of there. Sorry. Zach and Sebastian, you take Ned and Peter\\'s seats. That\\'s all right. Ned, thanks for bringing this to my attention. Your safety is my responsibility. And Mr. Dell\\'s, but he\\'s I got it for now. Let\\'s go, Peter! Let\\'s go! Yeah, I have a small bladder, so I took the aisle. So did you want to play Beast Slayer? Nope. Have you ever played any kind of PC game or? No. Got it. Did I tell you how my wife pretended to Blip out? Turns out, she ran off with a guy in her hiking group. We had a fake funeral for her. Well, the funeral was real because I thought she was really dead. Wanna see the video? Oh, I got a dual-headphone adapter if you want to watch a movie. Only if it\\'s depressing. Or hilarious. Oh, you have a dual-headphone adapter. We can watch together. Good afternoon, this is your captain speaking. Our flight time will be eight hours, 49 minutes to Venice, Italy. Nice picture. Hey, did you see Brad and MJ on the plane? They were watching movies and laughing the entire time. Dude, don\\'t worry, okay? I\\'m sure that\\'s nothing. Hey, babe. Can you hold this? Yeah, of course. Thanks. What was that? Well, we got to talking on the plane, and it turns out, we have a lot in common. So we\\'re boyfriend and girlfriend now. Whatever happened to being an American bachelor in Europe? Peter, those were the words of a boy.  And that boy met a woman. A very strong and powerful woman. And now that boy\\'s a man. Babe? Coming, babe. There\\'s nothing in there. I swear. These, no. Sorry. Sorry. I\\'m here. Mr. Harrington. Wait, wait, wait. I\\'m here, I\\'m here. Oh, thank goodness. Looks like we\\'re here. They\\'re doing renovations to the place. Getting some upgrades. Oh, this is trash. That must be the concierge. Okay. Come on, man. Everyone, here we are. Tell me we\\'re not staying here. Come on in. This place is sinking. You mean, \"charming.\" It stinks. Okay, everybody, drop your bags off. We\\'re gonna meet at the da Vinci Museum at 3. Let\\'s go! Vamonos! It\\'s \"andiamo.\" Andiamo! There you go. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. When you\\'re in Venice, your socks get wet. What\\'s up, Flash Mob? How you guys doing? I\\'m here in St. Marco Polo\\'s This is so much fun. Yeah? Three, two, one. Say \"pizza.\" Pizza! Pizza time! Hi. I\\'m looking for a It\\'s perfect. What? The most perfect word. Italians created it, I just discovered it. What does it mean? It can mean a million things. \"I don\\'t know.\" \"Get out of my face.\" \"I don\\'t know\" and \"Get out of my face.\" It\\'s the best thing Italy created, except for, maybe, espresso. Oh, so you\\'ve been drinking espresso. Hey. German? American. A rose for you. \"Boh\" is my new superpower. It\\'s like the anti-\"aloha.\" I was born to say this word. So, what\\'s in the bag? Nice. Whoa, cool. What was that? Betty! You okay? Yeah. Oh, my God! Come on. Guys, we gotta go! What is that? I don\\'t know. What\\'ll you do? Left my suit in the hotel. Why? I\\'m on vacation, Ned! Everyone will see my face. Get them out of here. Go! Just go! Get out of here. Go! Oh, my God.  Come on. Oh, no, you don\\'t. You okay? Get out of here. Go! Excuse me, sir! I I can help. Let me help. I\\'m really strong, and I\\'m sticky. I need to lead it away from the canals. The da Vinci Museum. This is why we\\'re here in Venice. Oh, this is it. It\\'s closed. What do you mean? Till when? November. You didn\\'t check the website? Oh, that\\'s a good idea. Oh, come on. Stay low, kids. We\\'ll be safe here. Who is that guy? I don\\'t know, but he\\'s kicking that water\\'s ass. Yeah! Yeah! It\\'s aliens. It has to be. BuzzFeed says there\\'s a sailor named Morris Bench who was exposed to an experimental underwater generator and got hydro powers. Yeah, you should definitely believe everything you read on the Internet. Spider-Man could take him. What do you think it is? Being a man of science witches. No, no, no. We wanna stay. Good thing I packed your suit. I can\\'t believe you forgot it. Yeah. So who was that guy that you were with? Was that Mr. Strange? Doctor Strange, May. Doctor Strange. And, no, I don\\'t know who that was. It was a new guy. I was trying to help him Happy, that\\'s my lunch. Don\\'t eat that one. Happy\\'s there? Yeah, it\\'s Happy. He\\'s here. He came by to volunteer. And he\\'s hanging around the office. And he wants to say hi. I don\\'t want Hi, Peter. Hey, Happy. Sorry, I\\'m working hard here. I gotta do a A leaflet drop. What are you doing? Glad you\\'re having a good time. Don\\'t worry, I\\'m really taking care of your aunt. So how\\'s the plan going? There\\'s been setbacks, for sure. Don\\'t overthink it. Trust your instincts and you\\'ll be fine. I know. Love you. Bye. Who is that guy? He\\'s like Iron Man and Thor rolled into one. He\\'s all right. He\\'s no Spider-Man. What is it with you and Spider-Man? What? He\\'s just awesome, okay?  He protects the neighborhood and he\\'s inspiring. He inspires me to be a better man. What\\'s up, dickwad? Thought you drowned. Sounds like his name\\'s Mysterio. \"L\\'uomo del misterio\" is Italian for \"man of mystery.\" They don\\'t actually know who he is. Mysterio. Cool name. Cool name. Babe. Babe. So how much of that did you see? Not much. I was running. Right. Me too. I was also running away. So Paris tomorrow. Go to the Eiffel Tower. Should be great. Yeah, I read it was secretly built as a mind-control antenna to create an army of the insane. Which is why it\\'s my favorite destination on the whole trip. What are you gonna do about the water monster? Nothing. It\\'s dead. Besides, that Mysterio guy\\'s all over it. I just wanna spend some time with MJ. We were talking about Paris, and I think she really likes me. That\\'s nice. Reminds me of when Betty and I first fell in love. I had just finished my fruit cobbler, right, and You\\'re a very difficult person to contact, Spider-Man. You\\'re Nick Fury. And you just shot Ned. It\\'s a mild tranquilizer. He\\'ll be all right. So good to finally meet you. I saw you at the funeral, but I didn\\'t think that was a good time to exchange numbers. That would\\'ve been inappropriate. That\\'s what I just said. Right. The important thing is, you\\'re here. I tried to bring you here. You avoided me, and now you\\'re here. What a coincidence. Wait. Was this a coincidence? I used to know everything. Then I come back five years later, and now I know nothing. No intel, no team. And a high school kid is dodging my calls. Here\\'s what I do know: A week ago, a village in Mexico was wiped out by a cyclone. Witnesses say that cyclone had a face. Three days later, a similar event in Morocco. A village was Just making the rounds.  See if anyone needs any counseling after today\\'s traumatic events. No, we\\'ll be okay. We\\'re fine. Thank you. Great because I\\'m I\\'m not qualified to actually Oh, he\\'s passed out. I\\'m not qualified to do it anyway, so good night. That was my teacher. Sorry about that. You were saying? A village was destroyed by what may well be another world-threatening Babe, you still awake? You\\'re not answering any of my texts. He\\'s asleep, Betty. Oh, already? Yeah. Okay. That\\'s why it\\'s imperative Hey, boys. So that canal water today was filled with dangerous bacteria Another person touches that door, we are going to attend another funeral. Suit up. Let me know if you develop vomiting. Stark left these for you. Really? \"Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.\" Stark said you wouldn\\'t get that because it\\'s not a Star Wars reference. You can lose the mask. Everyone here has seen you without it. You\\'d be feigning anonymity and breathing through spandex for no good reason. Come on. Yeah. Over there, we have Maria Hill. That is Dimitri. And this is Mr. Beck. Mysterio? What? Doesn\\'t matter. It\\'s just what my friends have been calling you. Well, you can call me Quentin. You handled yourself well out there today. I saw what you did with the tower. We could use someone like you on my world. Thanks. I\\'m sorry. Your world? Mr. Beck is from Earth. Just not yours. There are multiple realities. This is Earth Dimension 616. I\\'m from Earth 833. Sorry, you\\'re saying there\\'s a multiverse? I thought that was theoretical. That changes how we understand the initial singularity. We\\'re talking about an eternal inflation system. How does that even work with all the quantum? It\\'s insane. Sorry. It\\'s really cool. Don\\'t ever apologize for being the smartest one in the room.  Anyway They were born in stable orbits within black holes. Creatures formed from the primary elements: Air, water, fire, earth. The Science Division had a technical name. We just called them Elementals. Versions of them exist across our mythologies. Turns out, the myths are real. Like Thor. Thor was a myth, now I study him in my physics class. These myths are threats. They first materialized on my Earth many years ago. We mobilized and fought them, but with each battle, they grew, got stronger. I was part of the last battalion left trying to stop them. All we did was delay the inevitable. The Elementals are here now, attacking the same coordinates. Our satellites confirm it. Thank Mr. Beck for destroying the other three. There\\'s only one left: fire. The strongest of them all. The one that destroyed my Earth. It\\'s the one that took my family. I\\'m sorry. And it will be in Prague in approximately 48 hours. We have one mission: kill it. And you\\'re coming with us. I\\'m sorry, did you say Prague? Mr. Fury, this all seems like bigtime, you know, huge superhero kind of stuff. And I\\'m just a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, sir. Bitch, please. You\\'ve been to space. I know, but that was an accident. There\\'s gotta be someone else you can use. What about Thor? Off-world. Okay, Doctor Strange. Unavailable. Captain Marvel. Don\\'t invoke her name. Sir, look, I wanna help. I do. But if my aunt finds out I left my class trip, she\\'ll kill me. And if I\\'m seen in Europe after the Washington Monument, my class will figure out who I am, then Then the whole world will figure out who I am, and then I\\'m done. Okay. I understand. I\\'m sorry, what? Why don\\'t you get back before your teachers miss you and become suspicious.  Dimitri. Take him back to the hotel, please. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Fury. And good luck. See you, kid. Yeah, see you. Bye, ma\\'am. Yeah. Drink lots of water. I\\'m gonna get you a vitamin C pill. You cannot get sick, okay? Okay. Thanks, baby. Hey, are you sure you\\'re good? Oh, dude, I\\'m fine. Okay. Nice. Don\\'t worry. Getting tranq\\'d in the neck by Nick Fury, probably the coolest thing to ever happen to me. It is pretty awesome. Yeah. I\\'m happy I don\\'t have to go to Prague. Seriously. Good news. We\\'re going to Prague. What? Prague? Yeah. Tour company called. They upgraded us. You should\\'ve heard me on the phone with them. I really gave them hell. All I heard was crying. Look at our upgraded ride. Whoa, bro, you see that? It\\'s pretty sick. I\\'m impressed, Mr. Harrington. Oh, come on. Peter, what? What\\'s going on? I think Nick Furyjust hijacked our summer vacation. I\\'m Mr. Harrington to the kids Oh, all right. Okay. Awesome. Yeah. Awesome. Yo, what\\'s up, Flash Mob? It\\'s your boy, the Big F, cruising through the Alps with my private driver, Dimitri. \"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you. Say EDITH.\" Stand by for retinal and biometric scan. Retinal and biometric scan accepted. Hello? Hello, Peter. I am EDITH, Tony Stark\\'s augmented-reality security and defense system. So he made you for me? No. But you have access to all of Tony\\'s protocols. Cool. Would you like to see what I can do? EDITH stands for \"Even dead, I\\'m the hero.\" Tony loved his acronyms. Yeah, he did. I have access to the entire Stark Global Security network, including multiple defense satellites, as well as back doors to all major telecommunication networks. Is MJ texting? No. Don\\'t look at it. Don\\'t look at it. That\\'s wrong. That\\'s wrong. Petrol and toilets. Ten minutes!  Flash Mob, this is what we doing out here Toilet, toilet, toilet. Which way to the toilet? Ten minutes, everyone. Dimitri, where exactly are we? Okay. I\\'ll figure it out. Oh, my gosh, it\\'s so sick. It\\'s beautiful. What? Hello. Close the door. I\\'m Peter Parker. Take off your clothes. Excuse me? You told Fury Spider-Man cannot be seen in Europe. So I made you this, another suit. Oh, thank you. I\\'m sure it fits fine. I don\\'t need to try Take off your clothes. Okay. Sure. It\\'s a little embarrassing. Now. Hurry up. This is weird. No, no, no. Don\\'t Sorry. I thought this was the bathroom. This is not what it looks like. Just Yeah. What are you doing? I\\'ll leave you alone. Oh, my God. Don\\'t shoot anybody. Brad? It\\'s not what it looks like, buddy. Hey, man, look, that\\'s Look, Peter, I\\'m not here to judge your life choices, dude. If you want to hook up with some random European chick, that\\'s on you. That\\'s not what that was. I can\\'t pretend I didn\\'t see what I saw. I know you\\'re trying to get with MJ. It\\'s obvious. But I like her too. Wait a minute. Hey, hey. You cannot show her that photo, dude. I\\'m sorry, man. I have to. She deserves the truth. Okay, put your one foot in front of the other, and, everybody, back on the bus. It\\'s been 10 minutes. Let\\'s go! What\\'s up, Flash Mob? It\\'s your boy, Big F EDITH? Hello, Peter. How can I help you? Hey. There\\'s this guy in my class who\\'s gonna ruin everything with MJ Peter, I\\'m having difficulty hearing you. Can you please speak up? Brad Davis. He has a photo of me. Brad Davis. Is he a target? Is Brad a target? Yeah. He\\'s a target. He\\'s a target. Copy that. Target is Brad Davis. Initiating strike. Initiating what, now? Intercept point determined. Releasing kill vehicle. EDITH.  Oh, my God. Dope glasses, Parker. How\\'d you pay for these? Flash, give them back. I\\'m really paying you a compliment. Please give me I\\'m so sorry. EDITH, don\\'t kill Brad. Do you want me to cancel the drone strike on Brad Davis? Did you punch Flash? No. Firing. Oh, look out! Hey, this is not the autobahn! EDITH. Harrington! Is this the autobahn? Appears to be. Commencing second strike. Peter. Plant your fanny and buckle up now. Look at the baby mountain goats! Baby mountain goats? I see them. I don\\'t see any mountain goats. You missed them. I know you think none of us have noticed, Peter What? but your new look, I love it. Right, babe? Thanks. Yeah. Sophisticated, classy, very European. Oh, man. Let\\'s try that again. This is so weird. It was right here on my phone. I Yeah. Weird. Whoa, freaking beautiful. This is amazing. Wow, this place is so classy. Yeah, so why are we here? Speak for yourself. I\\'m home. What can I say? The squeaky wheel gets the upgrade grease. Everyone get settled, rest up because tonight, big surprise, is Prague\\'s annual Carnival of Lights. Yeah! Hello? Parker, it\\'s Hill. There\\'s an earpiece with your suit. Put it on and await further instructions. Understood? Yes, ma\\'am. Yeah. Hey, man. Hey. Look, I am so sorry if I seem like I\\'m preoccupied with my relationship. I\\'m still your guy in the chair. No, it\\'s all good. Don\\'t worry about it. Okay. Great, great. It\\'s fine. So, what\\'s the status on the Elemental thing? Where\\'s it gonna happen? Here in the city. We\\'re here. I know. It\\'s not good. I\\'m figuring it out. You have to do something, please. We\\'re counting on you. Ned. Yeah. Yeah, babe. The good news is, we\\'ve all got our own rooms. It\\'s about time. Serious? Parker? Parker! Yes, sir. That thing is going to be here in a few hours.  Are we boring you? He\\'s not bored. He\\'s thinking about how you kidnapped him. He had obstacles. I removed them. They still won\\'t evacuate the city. Idiots. So, what\\'s the plan, Parker? I will be in the cathedral tower, keeping watch for the fire monster. When that shows up, I will radio you guys, and then Mr. Beck and I will My name is Mysterio. That\\'s when Mysterio and I will move in. Peter, listen to me. The best hope you have, the only hope, is to stop it here now, no matter what the cost. Maneuver it away from civilians if you can, but most important, keep it away from metal. If it gets too big, it\\'ll draw power from the Earth\\'s core. After that, there\\'s no way to stop it. Hey, my friends are here. I can\\'t help but think we\\'re putting them in danger. You\\'re worried about us hurting your friends? You, who called a drone strike on your own school tour bus? Stark gave you a multibillion-dollar A.R. tactical intelligence system, and the first thing you do with it is try and blow up your friends. It\\'s clear to me that you were not ready for this. Fury asked me to come up here and see how you were doing. He just He felt bad about snapping at you. Really? You guys do have sarcasm on this Earth, right? How you feeling? I didn\\'t think I was gonna have to save the world this summer. I know that makes me sound like such a jerk. I just I had this plan with this girl that I really like and now it\\'s all ruined. You\\'re not a jerk for wanting a normal life, kid. It\\'s a hard path. You see things. You do things. You make choices. People look up to you and even if you win a battle, sometimes they die. I like you, Peter. You\\'re a good kid. There\\'s a part of me that wants me to tell you, just turn around, run away from all this.  Then there\\'s another part of me that knows what we\\'re about to fight, what\\'s at stake, and I\\'m glad you\\'re here. Me too. But you\\'re worried about your friends. Yeah. Just always feel like I\\'m putting them in danger. Look, just get them inside and keep them in a safe place for just a few hours. They\\'ll be all right. It\\'s really nice to have somebody to talk to about superhero stuff, you know? Anytime. And, hey, we survive this, you\\'ll have all summer to kill Brad. See you out there. All right. Sorry, that\\'s Italian. Okay. EDITH? Oh, come on. Hello, Peter. Hey. I need a way to keep my friends inside the next few hours. Let\\'s see what we can do. Good news. We\\'re going to the opera! You\\'re kidding me. The opera? Don\\'t look at me. What happened to the carnival? This is upgrade living. Come on. The tour company just gave us these tickets. For free! Do you have any idea how much opera tickets cost? No, because none of us have ever wanted to go to the opera, ever. I think this is gonna be culturally enriching for us. Thank you, Ned. Everyone, this is gonna be, maybe, the best four hours of our whole trip. Four hours? Guys, I think this is gonna be really fun. Seriously. I bet now you\\'re all happy I had you pack a nice outfit. Yeah, because we\\'d much rather go to a four-hour opera instead of the biggest party in the world. Again, don\\'t look at me. Parker, do you copy? Comm check, one, two. Okay, here we are. Beat the rush. Yeah, the rush out. Lucky for us, we got the best seats in the house. Let\\'s go. Hey. I\\'ll save you a seat. You look really pretty. And therefore, I have value? No, that\\'s not what I meant at all. I was just I\\'m messing with you. Thank you. You\\'re welcome. You look pretty too. Thank you. Oh, my gosh! Opera glasses! So cute.  Can I? Yeah. Want to go in on a pair? You mean, sit next to each other? Yeah. Are you in position? No. Okay. No Why the hell not? Parker? you don\\'t want to sit next to me, or, no, you just don\\'t want the glasses? I didn\\'t mean that. If you go ahead, I\\'ll go grab us a pair. I\\'ll save you a seat next to me. A lot of seats, so I\\'ll be up there. Awesome. Okay. Parker. No, I\\'m coming. I\\'m Hey, I gotta go. Could you tell MJ that I\\'m sick or something? Okay. Be careful. And whatever you do, please steer the monster away from the opera house. Yeah, Ned, I know. Okay. Okay? Yeah. Gotta go. Parker! You better be on your way. Coming. Where do you think she\\'s going? To the carnival? Oh, I I don\\'t We should go. Yes, we should go. Come on, let\\'s go. Come on. All right. I\\'m in position. As soon as I see something, Beck, I\\'ll I\\'ll let you know. Roger that. How\\'s the suit? The suit\\'s great. It\\'s awesome. It\\'s a little tight around the old web-shooter. Parker! Okay, I\\'ll shut up. Oh, my God, babe, isn\\'t this beautiful? Yeah, it\\'s real beautiful, babe. What\\'s wrong? You know, honestly, I just I don\\'t do well with big crowds, so maybe we should I have the perfect thing. Come on. Don\\'t worry, babe. We\\'ll get away from the crowds, get some fresh air. You\\'ll feel a thousand times better. Energy spiking. We have seismic activity. Okay, he\\'s here! Beck, you ready? You know what to do. On your lead, Spider-Man. No, come back! Come back and help us! You\\'re up, kid. Wait, wait. Is that? Do you think that\\'s Spider-Man? No, no, no. It\\'s a European rip-off version of him. I actually read about him. It\\'s not him. No, Beck! He\\'s got the carousel! He\\'s getting bigger! What\\'s his name? What\\'s his name? It\\'s Night Night Monkey. Night Monkey? Yeah.  Yeah. Night Monkey! Yeah. Night Monkey. Night Monkey, help! Save us! Night Monkey, we\\'re stuck! What? Oh, no, no. Help us! Help! Are you okay? On to Plan B? Yeah! We gotta hit him with something he can\\'t absorb! I go left, you go right! Now! Okay, shoot him! Yeah! That hurt him. Keep it coming. Spider-Man, keep your distance. I\\'m trying! Can\\'t let him get near the Ferris wheel. Okay. I\\'m on it! Whoa, what is that?! Betty! Betty! That\\'s it! Nice! Nice! You got him! No, no, no. It\\'s too late. Whatever happens I\\'m glad we met. Beck, what are you doing? What I should have done last time. Beck, don\\'t do it! Beck! Mr. Beck? Oh, thank God. I would kiss you, but I think I threw up in my mouth a little. I might have a mint. So it\\'s over? That was the last of them. But not the last threat we\\'ll ever face. We need to stay vigilant. There\\'s a void in this world for someone like you. Hill and I are going to Europol headquarters in Berlin tomorrow. You should join us. Thank you. I just might take you up on that. You got gifts, Parker, but you didn\\'t wanna be here. Mr. Fury, I I\\'d love to have you in Berlin too. But you got to decide whether you\\'re going to step up or not. Stark chose you. He made you an Avenger. I need that. The world needs that. Maybe Stark was wrong. Was he? The choice is yours. Let\\'s get a drink. I\\'m not 21. Hey. You gotta celebrate. We did something good tonight. Yeah. Fury was right. Tony did a lot for me so I owe it to him, to everybody. Do you? Yeah. I mean Mr. Stark gave me the chance to be more. He wanted me to be better than him. And Fury wants me to live up to that. What do you want? What do you mean? What do you want? I don\\'t know. What do you want? Peter Parker. Now. I know you\\'re thinking about it. I wanna go on my trip.  I want to go back on my trip with my friends. And go to the top of the Eiffel Tower with the girl who I really like and tell her how I feel and give her a kiss. Shut up, man. You\\'re not gonna do that, are you? No, I can\\'t. Why not? Because I have too much of a responsibility. My God. Thank you so much. What are those? Are those the? EDITH glasses, yeah. They were just on the floor? Try them on. Let\\'s see how they look on you. Yeah? Yeah. I actually really like them. Can I be completely honest with you? Please. They look really stupid. But maybe they have a contact-lens version. You try them on. No, come on. Try them on. I don\\'t wanna try them on. Just put them on. What do you think, kid? \"Next Tony Stark, I trust you.\" \"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.\" What? Stark left me a message with those glasses: \"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.\" I\\'m still not following. How many lemonades have you had? He knew every mistake I ever made. He must\\'ve known I wasn\\'t ready for something like this. Why give it to you? Maybe he didn\\'t trust me to have EDITH, he just trusted me to pick who should. It makes much more sense. He knew I\\'d do what\\'s right. And he\\'s not gonna give them to Fury because Fury would give himself EDITH. You\\'re probably right. Right, so the world needs the next Iron Man. And it\\'s not me. I\\'m a 16-year-old kid from Queens. It needs to be an adult with some experience and that\\'s good like Tony Stark, like you. No. Peter, come on. No. EDITH? Hello, Peter. Hi. Yeah I\\'d like to transfer your control over to Quentin Beck. Peter, what are you doing? Doing the right thing. Any transfer will require confirmation. Stark gave you the glasses. Stark gave me a choice. It\\'s my choice to make, okay? And I\\'m gonna make it.  You\\'re a soldier, a leader. You stopped the Elementals. You saved my life. You saved the world, okay? He\\'d want you to have them. Waiting for confirmation. Confirm. Welcome to the Avengers. They look good on you. Thank you. It\\'s an honor. Yeah. Mr. Stark would\\'ve really liked you. Where you headed? I\\'m gonna go find MJ. Good luck, kid. I\\'ll give you a fifty-fifty chance. You\\'re pretty awkward. Yeah. See you later, man. See you. See? That wasn\\'t so hard. Yes! Somebody get this stupid costume off me! Okay, we got EDITH. Get these connected to our system. Toast! Toast! Toast! No, this is a big win, but we still got a lot of work to do. Toast! Toast! Toast! Yeah! Okay, toasts! Give me that, Doug. To the man who brought us all together, our former boss, Tony Stark. The jester king. Literally wrapped in wealth and technology that he was unfit to wield. Like the holographic system I designed. A revolutionary breakthrough with limitless applications that Tony turned into a self-therapy machine and renamed Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF. Oh, $611 million for my little therapeutic experiment. He renamed my life\\'s work \"BARF.\" I told him it was a mistake, that my technology could change the world. And then he fired me. Said I was unstable. To Tony. To Tony! Next, to William. William! Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave! With a box of scraps! The integration of my illusion tech with your weaponized drones was brilliant. Powerful illusions, real damage, worked like a charm. And it\\'s just the beginning. Thank you, brother. To Guterman. Guterman! To Guterman! The story you created of a soldier from another Earth named Quentin fighting space monsters in Europe is totally ridiculous and apparently the kind of thing people will believe right now.  I mean, everybody bought it. Gutes! Guterman! To Victoria. To Victoria! Staging electromagnetic pulses at each attack site so Fury\\'s own satellites would confirm our lies. Inspired idea. To Janice. Janice! After Tony died, she was the one who discovered that EDITH was being handed over not to us, not to the Defense Department, but to a child. Thank you. To Janice! And to the rest of you, Tony Stark is gone. There is a window of opportunity, and someone will step up. But these days, you can be the smartest guy in the room, the most qualified, and no one cares. Unless you\\'re flying around with a cape or shooting lasers from your hands, no one will even listen. Well, I\\'ve got a cape and lasers. With our technology and with EDITH, Mysterio will be the greatest hero on Earth! Yeah! Then everyone will listen! Not to a boozy man-child. No! Not to a hormonal teenager. No! To me and to my very wealthy crew. To us. To us. To Mysterio! To Mysterio! To Peter Parker. To Peter Parker! Poor kid. Let\\'s get to work. Peter, oh, my God. Hey. Hey. We almost died. It\\'s fine. It\\'s fine. Hey, I\\'m done with the mission. Dude, the trip\\'s over. What? There\\'s monsters coming out of the ground. Of course our parents want us home. Don\\'t put me on hold. Peter, you\\'re not dead. Oh, my God. Yes, good. Stay here. Don\\'t Put some clothes on. We\\'re booking flights. We came for science, we\\'re leaving because of witches. Welcome to the new Dark Ages. What is going on? We\\'re going home in the morning. No, no. All the Elementals are gone. Ned. Coming, sweetie. Hey, can you guys keep it down? I\\'m live-streaming. Yeah. Hey. Hey. Where were you? I got lost. We were worried about you.  Good thing you\\'re back. Yeah. So much for Paris. It would\\'ve been fun. Yeah. Night. Night. You look ni Okay. Hey. Hey. Look I\\'m not ready for this trip to be over yet, and I kind of want to do something fun that\\'s not on the itinerary or planned or with Mr. Harrington. Yes. \"Yes,\" like you wanna go? Yes. Awesome. I\\'ll see you outside in 10 minutes. Meet me outside in five minutes. Five is good. Okay. Okay, bye. Bye. Night Monkey, help us! Help! Night Monkey! Hey. Hey. Where do you wanna go? Who cares? Awesome. Okay. Let\\'s go. I\\'m glad we\\'re doing this. Yeah, me too. To see the city a bit. They used to execute people on this bridge. They would put them in a basket, and they would drown in the water. Sorry. It\\'s okay. There\\'s this thing I\\'ve been wanting to talk to you about for a while. Yeah? It\\'s our last night in Europe, and I had this plan that I wanted to tell you. I\\'m just gonna tell you. MJ, I \"I\\'m Spider-Man.\" What? That\\'s what you were gonna say. That you\\'re Spider-Man. No. I\\'m not Spider-Man. I\\'ve been watching you for a while now. It\\'s kind of obvious. I\\'m not Spider-Man. What would make you think that I was Spider-Man? Peter, Washington? Yeah? The fact that you disappear out of nowhere for no reason. No, I was sick. Remember? I had my The tummy? Susan Yang thinks you\\'re a male escort. What? Of course I\\'m not a male escort. Then you\\'re Spider-Man. I\\'m not Spider-Man at all. What about tonight? You snuck off, and you fought that thing. I saw you. You can\\'t have seen me because I\\'m not Spider-Man. Also, on the news, it was the Night Monkey. The Night Monkey? Yeah. That\\'s what it said on the news, and the news never lies. Night Monkey. Okay. What are you doing? Well, do the Night Monkey and Spider-Man use the same webs?  I mean, maybe. Maybe he\\'s a Spider Monkey. Who knows? Were you only watching me because you thought I was Spider-Man? Yeah. Why else would I be watching you? Doesn\\'t matter. Just thought that maybe What the hell was that? I don\\'t know. What is it, some kind of projector or something? Yeah, but it\\'s really advanced. It It looked so real. It Yeah, really real. Wait, does that mean that? The Elementals are fake? That doesn\\'t make any sense because we were there, right? There was fire and destruction, and Who would do something like that? Mysterio. I am Spider-Man. And I\\'ve really messed up. Wait. You\\'re being serious? You\\'re 100 percent serious? Because it\\'s not funny. No, I\\'m not joking. Because I was I was only like 67 percent sure. MJ So why are you here? Why are you on this school trip? I know you have a lot of questions, but we have to get out of here, okay? Okay. Okay. I can\\'t believe I figured it out! You took everything from me! This is for my family! Pause. Pause. Sorry. Yeah, can you just fast-forward to the end? Yep. Stand by. All right, fly, fly, fly, zap, zap, zap. Pause. I\\'m not in love with this choreography, but it\\'ll do. Kill image. De-cloak drones. All right, weapons. You want to weaponize? Yep. Weapons only. Stand by. Nice. Stop. Something. I don\\'t know what it is. It\\'s something Just dou You know what? Double the damage and then run it again. You want me to double it up? Yeah. All right. Cover your ears. That is good! That\\'s good. We on schedule? Oh, yeah. Uploading software hack to EDITH network. With her drones, we\\'ll create an event big enough to cover an entire city. All right, well done. Make sure every drone is weapons-hot. We need maximum damage. That is gonna cause a lot of casualties. Oh, yeah.  More casualties, more coverage. I gotta cut through the static. London is a beautiful city, and it will suffer, but they can rebuild. If I\\'m the next Iron Man, I need to save the world from an Avengers-level threat. But when its new savior descends, all those casualties will be forgotten. Janice, you\\'ll be in position with my quick-change armor for the victory lap? Of course. Do you wanna try? No, no, that\\'s What\\'s going on with my hand? Why is that happening? Oh, one of the drones that came back from the plaza was missing a projector. It\\'s fine. Wait, and you\\'re? You\\'re telling me this now? It\\'s It\\'s one drone. The image will be perfect, I promise. That projector is evidence. It\\'s going to tell people what we\\'re doing and how we\\'re doing it. I am trying to fool 7 billion people here, including Nick Fury, who happens to be the most paranoid and most dangerous person on the planet. If he catches on before I\\'ve killed him, he will put a bullet in my head. And nobody wants a bullet in their head, right? Right? William, can you look at me? Pull up EDITH. Hello, Quentin. Hi, honey. I need a level-five search, full-resource protocol for this device. Magnifying. There. Search everything going in and out of that building. Located. Shit. You know, William, one day, after I\\'ve had to kill Peter Parker because of this, I hope you remember that his blood is on your hands! I can\\'t believe I gave Beck those glasses. How could I be that stupid? He\\'s probably spying on me right now or sending a drone to come and kill me. You had access to killer drones? Yeah, I didn\\'t really want them, especially after I almost killed Brad. You almost killed Brad? Look, I have to call Mr. Fury and tell him that Beck\\'s a fraud but I think he tapped my phone. So, what are you gonna do?  I need my suit, and I have to go to Berlin and talk to Mr. Fury in person. Just Oh, Ned, perfect. The costume looks great for the costume party at the prince\\'s castle. She knows. I told her. He didn\\'t tell me. I figured it out. That\\'s cool. Like, a long time ago. Look, Mysterio is a fraud. But he saved me and Betty\\'s lives. He\\'s been faking the whole thing with illusion tech. Yeah, he\\'s using these, like, hologram projectors. That\\'s crazy. Yeah. So you guys were working the case together or what? It\\'s been mostly me. Ned, I need you to call May, get her to call Mr. Harrington, say she wanted me to stay with family in Berlin, okay? Got it. Easy. Wow, you guys lie with such ease. I gotta go. Wait, wait, wait. The projector. You\\'re gonna need this. Don\\'t tell anyone about this, okay? Anyone who knows is in danger. So you know too. It\\'s cool. I\\'ve known first, and I\\'ve known longer, but it\\'s not a competition. Excuse me. Do you know where? Nacht Monkey! No, wait, I didn\\'t Oh, man. Get in. Mr. Fury You\\'ve got a lot of explaining to do. No, no, no, listen. Wait until we\\'re secure. Okay. Right. So is there anything you want to tell us about your girlfriend? He\\'s talking about EDITH. I know I made a mistake, and I\\'m sorry, but he is not who you think he is. Beck is a liar. Mysterio, the Elementals, it\\'s all fake. He has some sort of illusion tech. That\\'s how he tricked you and tricked me into giving him EDITH. It\\'s a projector. I pulled it off the fire monster in Prague. So all that death and destruction we witnessed was created by this? No, not just this. I think he\\'s using drones. Well, if this is true, then Beck\\'s very dangerous and we need to be smart. Who else did you tell about this?  Parker? Parker! What\\'s wrong? It\\'s Beck. He\\'s here. What? Hill? No, it\\'s just an illu Fury! Wow, Peter, wow. I thought we were close. Fury always had to die, but not you. Stop hiding, Beck! I tried to help you walk away. Now you\\'re making me do this. You told me, you were just a kid. You told me, you wanted to run after that girl. Help me! MJ! Oh, God! Peter, what\\'s going on? I know this isn\\'t real. Do you, though? MJ! MJ! I don\\'t think you know what\\'s real, Peter. You need to wake up! I mean, look at yourself. You are just a scared little kid in a sweat suit. I created Mysterio to give the world someone to believe in. I control the truth. Mysterio is the truth. If you were good enough, maybe Tony would still be alive. Deep down, you know I\\'m right. You made your choice. And all you had to do was step aside. And now you have Fury. Beck\\'s people are trying to find everyone who could expose him. Who\\'d you tell? I know you told someone, so just tell me. Okay. Who did you tell? Who else did you tell?! Just Ned and MJ from my class. Maybe Ned told his girlfriend Betty, but that\\'s it. What? You are so gullible. What? You\\'re smart as a whip. Just a sucker. And now all your friends have to die. Oh, my God. It\\'s easy to fool people when they\\'re already fooling themselves. But for what it\\'s worth, Peter, I really am sorry. EDITH. Yes, Quentin. Access files to Peter Parker\\'s class trip. I need them to fly home from London. Hi. Where am I? Municipal holding facility. They said they found you unconscious at the train yard. Very dangerous. And we gave you the shirt because you seemed a bit cold. Thanks. You guys are nice. You speak really good English. Welcome to the Netherlands. I\\'m in the Netherlands right now? Yep. Bye. Guard!  The guard is on a break. Probably talking to his wife. Yeah, she\\'s pregnant. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Night Monkey. Yeah. You guys okay? Excuse me, sir? Yeah? Could I borrow your phone? Yeah. Everyone is so nice here. Okay. Okay. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Hey, hey I messed up. I need a I need a ride. Where am I? Where am I, sir? It\\'s Broek op Langedijk. Hang on. Could you say that into there? Hi. It\\'s Broek op Langedijk here. Yeah, no problem. Thanks. Did you get that? Peter? Are you okay? Happy, is that you? Yeah, of course it\\'s me. Stop! Tell me something only you would know. Only I would know Remember when we went to Germany? You pay-per-viewed a video in your room? They didn\\'t list the titles, but I could tell by the price it was an adult film. And you didn\\'t know how I knew Okay, fine! It\\'s you. Stop. It\\'s so good to see you. You\\'ll have to tell me what the hell is going on here. Okay, hold still. There we go. Ouch. I thought you had super strength. It still hurts. Happy, come on. All right, relax. Just a few more. There we go. Oh, my God, Happy. Relax. Don\\'t tell me to relax, Happy! How can I relax when I messed up so bad? I trusted Beck. Right? I thought he was my friend. I gave him the only thing Mr. Stark left for me, and now he\\'s gonna kill my friends and half of Europe, so please do not tell me to relax. I\\'m sorry, Happy. I\\'m sorry. I shouldn\\'t shout. I just really miss him. Yeah, I miss him too. Everywhere I go I see his face. And the whole world is asking who\\'s gonna be the next Iron Man and I don\\'t know if that\\'s me, Happy. I\\'m not Iron Man. You\\'re not Iron Man. You\\'re never gonna be Iron Man. Nobody could live up to Tony. Not even Tony. Tony was my best friend. And he was a mess. He second-guessed everything he did. He was all over the place.  The one thing that he did that he didn\\'t second-guess was picking you. I don\\'t think Tony would have done what he did if he didn\\'t know that you were gonna be here after he was gone. Now, your friends are in trouble, you\\'re all alone, your tech is missing. What are you gonna do about it? I\\'m gonna kick his ass. But I mean, right now. Specifically, what are we gonna do? Because we\\'ve been hovering over a tulip field for the last 15 minutes. Right. I can\\'t call my friends because he\\'s tracking their phones. Give me your phone. My cell phone? Yeah. Okay. Here. What\\'s your password? \"Password.\" No, what is your password? \"Password,\" spelled out. Head of security, and your password is \"password\"? I don\\'t feel good about it either. Hello, governor. Cup of tea for you? I\\'m gonna be in London soon. They\\'re in London. London, okay. Yeah, I need a suit. Suit? Okay bring up everything you have on Spider-Man. Yeah, open that. Okay, no, no, no. What? Nothing. You take care of the suit. I\\'ll take care of the music. Oh, I love Led Zeppelin. Okay, can you pull up my web-shooters? Isolate the Taser webs, and reconfigure and boost the voltage to a factor of 25 percent, and give me complete manual control over detonation. I thought Kree having sleeper cells was top secret information. Nick, satellites are picking up an EM pulse. I thought that was over. It\\'s the biggest one yet. Where? London. Okay, the company set up a city tour, and then we\\'ll grab a bite and head to the airport. Is no one else going to acknowledge how crazy this is? Oh, yeah, I get it. There\\'s been nothing scientific about this science tour at all. No, I\\'m talking about Peter. Has no one noticed how shady he is?  Because I saw him in the back room of a rest stop with some woman in his underwear, and he\\'s always sneaking away, like back at the opera, huh? Now he\\'s suddenly off the trip, with his family in Berlin? Is no one else interested in the truth? \"The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world.\" George Orwell. Thank you, MJ. Yeah. Well, since Peter\\'s not really here to tell his truth, what about you, Brad? Why take pictures of people in the bathroom? Yeah, what\\'s that about? No, no, no, it wasn\\'t like that. It was I was trying to take a Let\\'s just put all this craziness behind us and have a nice, peaceful afternoon. \"Sounds great, Mr. Harrington,\" said the class. Okay. I\\'m gonna be a cool teacher right now. You gotta stop doing that. It is weird. No more photos in the bathroom. Urinal or stalls. Okay? Look at this, guys. Mr. Harrington, this is your bus. We got a bus all to ourselves. Nice to see you all. Come along. I\\'ll get this, yeah? Why not? Thank you. Yeah. Thank you, brother. All right. I have the kids. I got here as fast as I could. I did a full perimeter sweep. Nothing. Damn it. Pulse is spiking. I\\'ll take another look. Soon as you see something, report. You\\'re all we\\'ve got, Beck. If this is what I fear, then God help us, Fury. God help us all. Okay, people, no Avengers coming. Good to go. William, launch the drones. Copy that, brother. Drones are entering the atmosphere weapons-hot. Excellent. Janice? Working on the cape. Get those wrinkles out. I could be shaking hands with the queen. Guterman? Almost in position. Okay. Hit it, Victoria. Increasing pulse. Whatever this thing is, it\\'s 100 times bigger than the previous ones. EDITH? Yes, Quentin. Show me my loose ends. Once the show\\'s going, execute the kill order on my command.  Copy. All right. Start the show. Let\\'s save the world, people. I don\\'t like this. Something\\'s definitely up. You\\'re an FOS now. \"Friend of Spider-Man.\" And you have to remember, just stay calm. That doesn\\'t look good. But it\\'s fake, there\\'s nothing to worry about. And the kids are in the kill zone. Great work, Guterman. What? Happy Hogan here. I know. What do you want? Over at Mr. Stark\\'s, going through his belongings. There was a surfboard you left behind. What? People there said they didn\\'t think Nick Fury was a surfer, but I said: \"Appearances can be deceiving.\" It\\'s not mine. And don\\'t ever call again. Fury\\'s got the coded message. Your friends are at the Tower Bridge. Your boy called it London Bridge, but I figured it out. I\\'ll scoop them up, okay? Yeah. We\\'re close. We\\'re close. How\\'s the suit? Almost done. Good. Wait, wait, whoa, whoa. Before you go if something happens to me, could you please give this to MJ? You\\'ll make it back. You\\'ll give it to her yourself. Okay? You got this. I got this. Walk me through it. I know it\\'s illusion tech. All I have to do is get inside the illusion, then I can take it down, find him, and he\\'s just a guy, so I can take EDITH right back. Right, but last time, you got hit by a train. True, but this time How do I explain this? I have a sixth sense. The Peter-tingle. That\\'s what you\\'re talking about, right? It\\'s not working, though. I heard it wasn\\'t working right now. Is it? It is working. I don\\'t know if it\\'s working So you got the Peter-tingle. That\\'s the plan. I\\'m gonna go get your friends. You get that Peter-tingle back online. I got this. Cue the lightning. Cuing lightning. Sir, is it still safe on the top, or should we all come down?  Oh, my. What did the bus driver say? Bus driver\\'s gone. What?! Where?! It\\'s okay. Mr. Dell and I have it under control! Oh, no. Don\\'t drag me into this, Roger. I\\'m doing my best, Julius! Look Oh, the witches are back. Oh, my God, get off the bus! Okay. Okay, follow me, kids. Come on, let\\'s go! Now, that is an Avengers-level threat. This way. This way! Okay. Okay. Oh, my God! Flash! Follow that cursed hand. This way, kids. Follow me. It\\'s not real, it\\'s not real! It looks real to me! Follow me, kids! Earth, wind, fire, water. Oh, no. Theyjoined forces like the Power Rangers. You\\'re thinking of Voltron. Who? Voltron! You\\'re thinking of Voltron! Hey, look, it\\'s Mysterio! He\\'s gonna save us! If Mysterio knows we know Then we\\'re in danger. Yeah, and so are they. We should go. Kill that witch! This is for my family! Get somewhere safe, Fury. I don\\'t see this ending well. I appreciate your concern, but I never leave my men behind. All right, comms check. Can you hear me, kid? I can. It\\'s a little loud out here. I like the new suit. Thanks. Whoa, Peter, you sure that\\'s not real? Yeah, it\\'s just 100 times bigger than I expected. Still the play? We need to get high enough so Beck doesn\\'t see me coming. Copy. Stay sticky. Hey, Happy. Yeah, kid. What is it? We need to have a serious conversation about you and my aunt! Beck, report! Guterman, I need a response. Something quick and decisive. \"It\\'s all the Elementals. They\\'re merged into something\" into something else. Something more powerful. It\\'s drawing energy from the Earth\\'s core. See, now, that\\'s some bullshit. Is that? Be ready for anything. Yeah. It\\'s not real, it\\'s not real, it\\'s not real! That\\'s awesome. William, I\\'ve got drones breaking formation. Maybe they hit a flock of birds. You\\'re fine.  I wanna see what\\'s happening Taking manual control. Do you see anything? Yeah. And I\\'m gonna kill him. I hope this works. You got me? I got you. Boss, the illusion is coming apart. I see you. EDITH, give me protection. Copy. Just kill the illusion. Kill it. I\\'m not gonna kill it. They\\'ll see. They\\'ll see what I want them to see! Do you still need the cape? Yes, Janice. I still need the cape. Done. William, render my illusion suit. All right, hang on. The monster was full of drones! It\\'s crazy! There you are. Easy. Who the hell is that? Ned! Happy! I gotta get you guys out of here! Get on the jet! Who are you? I work with Spider-Man, okay? Get on that jet. You work for Spider-Man? I work with Spider-Man, not for Spider-Man. New plan. Into the Tower. What? Happy, are you okay? We\\'re okay. Just get Beck. EDITH, target Spider-Man. Copy. I\\'ll just kill the kids myself. There you are. Into the Crown Jewels vault! Yeah, go, go, go! Come on. Go! Into the vault! The walls are 8 feet thick. Go into the vault! What? Into the vault. Go! Take cover! Okay. Yeah? No. No. I see you. Get that thing out Go! How does Cap do that?! Happy, say something, to let me know you\\'re alive! I\\'m here. I\\'m here. Happy, thank God. I bought us some time. But not much. I\\'m trying to get to Beck, but I can\\'t shake these drones! Gotcha. Going up! Finally. Hey, William, how we doing? Illusion almost back up. I don\\'t know how you\\'re gonna spin this. Oh, great. No webs. Are we gonna die? Nobody dies on my watch. I wasted my life playing video games, and we\\'re gonna die. I have a fake ID, and I\\'ve never even used it. I post stupid videos daily for people to like me. Hey, if it wasn\\'t for those stupid videos, Spider-Man would\\'ve never found you.  Spider-Man? Spider-Man follows me? I saved us, guys. If you saved us, why are we about to die? MJ! Stop it! I\\'m sorry, okay? I\\'m obsessed with telling the truth even if it hurts people\\'s feelings. I\\'m in love with Spider-Man\\'s aunt. We\\'re sharing, right? Your lies are over, Beck. This certainly isn\\'t ideal, but I have contingencies. EDITH? Just give me the glasses. You want these? Come and get them. Come on, Peter-tingle. Why aren\\'t these drones firing? You\\'re in the strike zone. The chance of getting hit is No, fire all the drones now! Beck! Beck. You lied to me. I trusted you. I know. That\\'s the most disappointing part. You\\'re a good person, Peter. Such a weakness. Stark was right. You do deserve them. You can\\'t trick me anymore. EDITH, turn off the drones. Biometric scan complete. Welcome back, Peter. Execute all cancellation protocols? Just do it. Execute them all. Confirmed. Give me the spear. That\\'s a halberd. Thank you. How could you do all of this? You\\'ll see, Peter. People, they need to believe. And nowadays they\\'ll believe anything. Is he? Is this real? All illusions are down, Peter. Yeah! Hey, where you going? MJ. Hey. Hey. Hey. Are you okay? I\\'m okay. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. Is everybody else okay? Yeah, everyone\\'s okay. What happened? There was just the drones, and they were following us, and then theyjust stopped. Was that you? Yeah. Did you get him? Yeah. Well, I brought that. In case you needed some help. Thanks. Anyway, there was this sweaty guy in the tower with us. I think he works for you or something. He He gave me this. No. No. Oh, MJ, I\\'m so sorry. I had this stupid plan. Peter. I wrote it down, I was gonna buy you this and give it to you in Paris at the top  And you kissed me. What? What? Yeah. I don\\'t really have much luck when it comes to getting close to people. So I lied. I wasn\\'t just watching you because I thought you were Spider-Man. That\\'s great. Black dahlia, like the murder. The murder. Good. Yeah. Sorry it\\'s broken. I actually like it better broken. I really like you. I really like you too. Okay. I should I should probably get back to the class. I\\'ll go and Yeah. I don\\'t know. Okay. Just in case. Yeah, no. No, May, you\\'re right. He did great. He was strong. Yeah. I\\'m glad he stayed too. I gotta go. I\\'m glad you\\'re alive. I guess the coded message worked. \"Appearances can be deceiving.\" I\\'m surprised you didn\\'t just wink in the camera. It worked. Only because I had serious doubts about Beck from the beginning. Not true. He had zero doubts. Where\\'s Parker? He\\'s with a girl. I need to speak with him. He\\'ll call you. He\\'ll? Okay. Great. Well, he better. Or it\\'s your ass. And don\\'t even think about ghosting me. Are you sure no one else has figured it out? Yeah, it\\'s not like anybody really pays attention to you. Ouch. Except for me. Thanks. Don\\'t be late. I won\\'t. See you later. You guys are so cute. Thanks. I was thinking we should all go on a double date or something. Oh, we broke up. Oh, we broke up. No. What? Why? Men and women grow apart, but the journey they share together will always be a part of them. You are so wise. Thank you. Hello, Gerald. Could Mother not make it? May! I promise you Oh, he\\'s here. Don\\'t give me a ticket. I\\'m so glad you\\'re okay. No, for real, I\\'m good. I\\'m actually really fine. Let\\'s go. Where are your bags? Oh, right. They got blown up. Yeah. I got you some hot buttered bagels. Thank you so much. I know my boy. I kept my identity pretty guarded this past couple years.  I faced a lot of deception. And I\\'m tired of the lies. So it\\'s time for the truth to be out there. Are you dating? Yes. Not really. What? Well I think Summer fling. Yes, that evolves and grows like any other. I still don\\'t know where it\\'s going to go. Open to wherever it might lead. Anywhere. On or off. To share it with people We\\'ll always be friends, no matter what. I\\'m gonna go because I\\'ve got a date. because we all are interconnected. Bye. We are. Sorry! Hey. Sorry I\\'m late. Hey. It\\'s fine. You ready? Yeah. You\\'re gonna love this. Okay! Okay! Okay. Okay. You ready? Yeah. I\\'m just not gonna watch. I\\'m not gonna watch. I should stop looking. I\\'m gonna stop looking! Okay. You can put me down now! You can put me down now! You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I\\'m okay. Let\\'s just Never, never doing that again. I\\'m never doing that again. Okay. I should probably get out of here. Be safe. See you later. This is breaking news. We come to you with revelations about last week\\'s attack in London. An anonymous source provided this video. It shows Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio, moments before his death. A warning, you may find this video disturbing. I managed to send the Elemental through the rift, but I don\\'t think I\\'m gonna make it. Spider-Man attacked me for some reason. He has an army of weaponized drones, Stark technology. He\\'s saying he\\'s the only one who\\'s gonna be the new Iron Man, no one else. Are you sure you want to commence the drone attack? There will be significant casualties. Do it. Execute them all. This shocking video was released earlier today on the controversial news website TheDailyBugle.net. There you have it, folks, conclusive proof that Spider-Man was responsible for the murder of Mysterio, an interdimensional warrior who gave his life to protect our planet and who will no doubt go down in history as the greatest superhero of all time.  But that\\'s not all, folks. Here\\'s the real blockbuster. Brace yourselves. Spider-Man\\'s real Spider-Man\\'s real name is Spider-Man\\'s name is Peter Parker. What the fu? You gotta tell him. It was fine. The little boy handled it. We helped. Talos. Come off it. How was I supposed to know that the whole thing was fake? I mean, that was all very convincing. The performances, the illusion, that costume, the craftsmanship in that. This is just embarrassing for a shape-shifter. Fine. Hey there. I hope your mission is going well. We gave the glasses to Parker about a week ago, like you said. And it was very touching, you know? Really, really quite touching. Talos. And, you know, shortly after that, it really kind of went off the rails, and so we need you to come back because everyone kept asking where the Avengers are, I don\\'t know what to say to that, so you\\'re lucky that Spider-Man won Everybody back to work! Who\\'s got my shoes?'],\n",
       " 'Avengers Endgame': ['  (After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War, the universe is in ruins. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos\\' actions and restore balance to the universe.)\\n (The screen first panels up to an arrow being nocked into a bow. The archer behind firmly grips it tight as it was aiming towards the target. The camera reveals Clint Barton holding up a few arrows while mentoring his daughter, Lila Barton, on shooting one.)\\n CLINT BARTON: Okay, hold on. Don\\'t shoot. You see where you\\'re going?\\n LILA BARTON: Mhm.\\n CLINT BARTON: Okay, now let\\'s worry about how you get there. [Clint corrects his daughter\\'s foot to the proper position, and adjusts her shooting stance.]\\n CLINT BARTON: Here. Can you see?\\n LILA BARTON: Yeah.\\n CLINT BARTON: You sure?\\n LILA BARTON: Mhm. [Clint pushes Lila\\'s hair in front of her face while covering her left eye.]\\n CLINT BARTON: How about now?\\n [Both Lila and Clint giggle, as the camera panels into a long shot showing a target nailed on a tree, and the rest of Barton family having a picnic in the field.]\\n CLINT BARTON: Alright. Ready your fingers.\\n COOPER BARTON: Nice.\\n LAURA BARTON: Nice throw, kiddo.\\n COOPER BARTON: You go.\\n LAURA BARTON: Hey, you guys want mayo or mustard, or both? [Camera switches to Lila who then proceeds to look at Clint.]\\n LILA BARTON: Who wants mayo on a hotdog?\\n CLINT BARTON: Probably your brothers.\\n [Clint looks at his wife, Laura]\\n CLINT BARTON: Uh, two mustard, please! Thanks, mama. [Camera switches to Laura facing Nathaniel]\\n LAURA BARTON: Mayo or mustard?\\n NATHANIEL BARTON: How about ketchup?\\n LAURA BARTON: Ketchup? [Camera switches back to Clint and his daughter] I can do ketchup.\\n CLINT BARTON: Mind your elbow. [Lila releases the arrow and it hits the target directly in the bullseye.] Hahaha! Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your arrow.\\n LAURA BARTON: Hey guys! Enough practice, soup\\'s on!\\n CLINT BARTON: Alright, we\\'re coming; we\\'re hungry. [Clint looks behind him, but there\\'s no one there, but dust being blown away by the wind.] Lila, let\\'s go. [Clint starts to look around] Lila? [Clint starts to move and look around, and pick up the bow she had.] Honey? [Clint looks around to see Laura and the boys, only they are gone now. He looks seriously panicked and confused as he hurriedly drops the arrows and jogs over to where they were.] Hey, babe! Babe? Babe? Boys? Boys? Laura?\\n [Lightning crackles]\\n [SOMEWHERE IN\\xa0SPACE]\\n [Marvel Studios Opening sequence begins with Dear Mr. Fantasy playing. Only the heroes who survived the snap are shown.]\\n [Scene switches to Nebula and Tony on the ship playing paper football]\\n NEBULA: Wrra! [Nebula, frustrated, puts her hands in a fighting stance while looking at Tony.]\\n TONY STARK: You don\\'t need to do that. Because uh... you\\'re just holding position. [Nebula flicks a paper football towards Tony] Oh yeah, that was close. [Nebula once again flicks a paper football towards Tony] That\\'s a goal. We\\'re now one apiece.\\n NEBULA: I would like to try again. [Nebula flicks a paper football towards Tony]\\n TONY STARK: We\\'re tied up. Feel the tension? It\\'s fun.\\n [Tony poorly flicks a paper football towards Nebula]\\n TONY STARK: That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win. [Nebula flicks the paper football towards Tony]\\n TONY STARK: And... you\\'ve won. Congratulations. [Tony reaches his hand out to shake Nebula\\'s hand]\\n TONY STARK: Fair game. Good sport. [Nebula shakes Tony\\'s hand] Have fun?\\n NEBULA: It was fun.\\n [Camera switches to see Iron Man\\'s busted helmet. Tony Stark\\'s hand reaches forward to turn on the helmet. We pan out to see that he\\'s sitting on the floor of a gloomy Benatar. The weight of the recent events of INFINITY WAR evident in Tony\\'s posture. He taps the helmet with a sigh.]\\n TONY STARK: This thing on? [The helmet scans Tony. Tony leans against the wall while taking deep breaths. He looks skinnier and weak with malnutrition.] Hey, Miss Potts... Pep. If you find this recording, don\\'t post it on social media. It\\'s gonna be a real tear-jerker. I don\\'t know if you\\'re ever going to see these. I don\\'t even know if you\\'re... if you\\'re still... Oh god, I hope so. Today is day 21, uh 22. [Cut to Tony standing at a window to stare out in space, waiting for his impending doom to arrive.] You know, if it wasn\\'t for the existential terror of staring into a void of space, I\\'d say I\\'m feeling better today. The infection\\'s run its course, Thanks to the blue meanie back there. [Cut to a shot of Nebula sitting in the back of the Benatar.] You\\'d love her. Very practical. Only a tiny bit sadistic. Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge to buy ourselves about 48 hours of time. [A shot of Tony and Nebula working on the fuel cells of the Benatar.] But it\\'s now dead in the water. We\\'re 1000 light years from the nearest 7-11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow. And that\\'ll be it. And Pep, I ... I know I said no more surprises, but I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like... well you know what it looks like. Don\\'t feel bad about this. I mean, if you grovel for a couple of weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt. I should probably lie down. Please know that... when I drift off, I will think about you. Because it\\'s always you.\\n [With that, Tony turns the helmet off. He rubs his thumb over the left eye, and then leans down, to what would be his last sleep. Nebula walks over to him, and carries him to Drax\\'s seat, and lies him there. She walks away dejected.]\\n [A vast bluish nebula illuminates the space surrounding them. Cut to a shot of Tony\\'s face, which for the first time shows age and weakness. There is a light on his face, which grows brighter and brighter until he\\'s forced to open his eyes. The camera pans around to the light source, which is slowly revealed to be CAROL DANVERS.]\\n [A bathroom in the Avengers compound. We see Steve Rogers holding a blade, having just shaved off his beard. He sighs and looks into a side mirror. The mirror suddenly starts shaking, slowly at first, and then severely. Cut to the yard in the Avengers Compound, we see Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, and James Rhodes walking out looking at something, the Benatar carried by Carol Danvers as she lands the spacecraft. The landing gears deploy as they touch down. The entry hatch opens, and Tony and Nebula walk out, Tony being supported by Nebula. Steve runs to Tony to help him stand up. Tony grips Steve\\'s arm as he joins him.]\\n TONY STARK: Couldn\\'t stop him.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Neither could I.\\n TONY STARK: I lost the kid.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Tony, we lost.\\n TONY STARK: Is, uh...? [Tony struggles to ask about Pepper.]\\n PEPPER POTTS: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! [She and Tony embrace.]\\n TONY STARK: It\\'s okay.\\n [Rocket Raccoon sits down with Nebula and takes her hand, both silently mourning their losses. In the Avengers Compound. The heroes are sitting in a living room area. Tony is sitting at a table, getting blood for healing. A holographic casualty report lists the names and faces of those lost to the Decimation.]\\n JAMES RHODES: It\\'s been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: World governments are in pieces. The parts that are still working are trying to take a census. And it looks like he did... he did exactly what he said he was gonna do. Thanos wiped out fifty percent, of all living creatures.\\n TONY STARK: Where is he now? Where?\\n STEVE ROGERS: We don\\'t know. He just opened a portal and walked through.\\n [Cut to a shot of a sullen-looking Thor, sitting on a bench, seemingly deep in thought.]\\n TONY STARK: What\\'s wrong with him?\\n ROCKET: Oh, he\\'s pissed. He thinks he failed. Which of course he did, but you know there\\'s a lot of that\\'s going around, ain\\'t there?\\n TONY STARK: Honestly, until this exact second, I thought you were a Build-A-Bear.\\n ROCKET: Maybe I am.\\n STEVE ROGERS: We\\'ve been hunting Thanos for three weeks now. Deep Space scans, and satellites, and we got nothing. Tony, you fought him.\\n TONY STARK: Who told you that? [Surprised] I didn\\'t fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the store. That\\'s what happened. There was no fight.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Okay.\\n TONY STARK: He\\'s unbeatable.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?\\n TONY STARK: Pfft! I saw this coming a few years back. I had a vision. I didn\\'t wanna believe it. Thought I was dreaming.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Tony, I\\'m gonna need you to focus.\\n TONY STARK: [starting to seethe] And I needed you. As in past tense. That trumps what you need. It\\'s too late buddy. Sorry. You know what I need? [Tony stands, pushing things off the table with a clatter. Everyone winces at the noise.] I need to shave. And I believe I remember telling all youse -\\n [Tony goes for Steve. Rhodey quickly comes in front of him, trying to stop him.]\\n RHODEY: Tony, Tony, Tony!\\n TONY STARK: Alive and otherwise what we needed was a suit of armor around the world! Remember that? Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not- that\\'s what we needed!\\n STEVE ROGERS: Well, that didn\\'t work out, did it?\\n TONY STARK: I said, \"we\\'d lose\". You said, \"We\\'ll do that together too.\" And guess what, Cap? We lost. And you weren\\'t there. But that\\'s what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We\\'re the Avengers, we\\'re the Avengers. Not the Prevengers.\\n RHODEY: Okay.\\n TONY STARK: Right?\\n RHODEY: You made your point. Just sit down.\\n TONY STARK: Okay...\\n RHODEY: Okay?\\n TONY STARK: Nah, nah. Here\\'s my point. You know what?\\n RHODEY: Tony, you\\'re sick.\\n TONY STARK: [Referring to Carol] She\\'s great, by the way.\\n RHODEY: Sit down. Sit.\\n TONY STARK: We need you. You\\'re new blood. Bunch of tired old mules! [Tony walks right up to Steve\\'s face, his voice hushing down to a venomous whisper] I got nothing for you, Cap! I got no coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero. Zip. Nada. No trust. Liar.\\n [Steve looks affected by Tony\\'s words. The old friends just gaze at each other. After a moment, Tony rips his Arc Reactor from his chest and shoves it into Steve\\'s hand.]\\n TONY STARK: Here, take this. You find him, and you put that on. You hide.\\n [Tony falls to the ground. Steve is by his side and everyone is starting to gather.]\\n STEVE ROGERS: Tony!\\n TONY STARK: I\\'m fine. I...\\n [Tony falls into a heap, unconscious.]\\n [Cut to a shot of Tony on a bed, with Pepper at his side.]\\n RHODEY: Bruce gave him a sedative. He\\'s gonna probably be out for the rest of the day.\\n CAROL DANVERS: You guys take care of him. And I\\'ll bring him a Xorrian Elixir when I come back.\\n [Carol walks away.]\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Where are you going?\\n CAROL DANVERS: To kill Thanos.\\n [Steve and Natasha share a look before walking after her.]\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Hey, you know, we usually work as a team here, and between you and I, morale\\'s a little fragile.\\n STEVE ROGERS: We realize up there is more your territory, but this is our fight too.\\n RHODEY: You even know where he is?\\n CAROL DANVERS: I know people who might.\\n NEBULA: [Standing behind Carol] Don\\'t bother. I can tell you where Thanos is. Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me. And when he worked, he talked about his great plan. Even disassembled, I wanted to please him. I\\'d ask \"where would we go once his plan was complete?\". His answer was always the same: \"To the Garden.\"\\n RHODEY: That\\'s cute, Thanos has a retirement plan.\\n STEVE ROGERS: So where is he?\\n ROCKET: When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. No one\\'s ever seen anything like it... Until two days ago. [A hologram of a planet pops up, with a shockwave visibly traversing the surface.] On this planet.\\n NEBULA: Thanos is there.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: He used the stones again.\\n BRUCE BANNER: Hey, hey, hey. We\\'d be going in short-handed, you know.\\n RHODEY: Look, he\\'s still got the stones, so...\\n CAROL DANVERS: So let\\'s get him... Use them to bring everyone back.\\n RHODEY: Just like that?\\n STEVE ROGERS: Yeah, just like that.\\n [Steve and Carol share a knowing look.]\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Even if there\\'s a small chance that we can undo this... I mean we owe it to everyone who\\'s not in this room to try.\\n BRUCE BANNER: If we do this, how do we know it\\'s gonna end any differently than it did before?\\n CAROL DANVERS: Because before, you didn\\'t have me.\\n RHODEY: Hey, new girl, everyone here is about that superhero life. And if you don\\'t mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time?\\n CAROL DANVERS: There are a lot of other planets in the universe. And unfortunately, they didn\\'t have you guys.\\n [Thor, who has been eating a snack behind all this time, stands up and walks over to Carol. She looks behind at him. He holds his hand up, and catches Stormbreaker as it flies over to him, missing Carol by inches. But Carol doesn\\'t even flinch, instead smiling at the God of Thunder.]\\n THOR: I like this one. [smiles]\\n STEVE ROGERS: Let\\'s go get this son of a bitch. (yes, cap just said what you thought)\\n [Title Screen: Avengers: Endgame]\\n [Cut to a shot of everyone except for Tony aboard the Benatar.]\\n ROCKET: Okay, who here hasn\\'t been to space?\\n [Nat, Cap, and Rhodey raise their hands.]\\n RHODEY: Why?\\n ROCKET: You better not throw up on my ship.\\n NEBULA: Approaching jump in 3... 2... 1!\\n [The ship jumps forward into a wormhole, and we see Steve holding onto his seat for dear life. A close up of his eyes show them widening slightly at the exhilaration of this new experience. The ship slows down, and the ship hovers in orbit of the planet seen in the hologram previously. Carol Danvers hovers in front of the Benatar.]\\n CAROL DANVERS: I\\'ll head down for recon.\\n [A shot of the passengers inside the Benatar preparing for the impending confrontation.]\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: This is gonna work, Steve.\\n STEVE ROGERS: I know it will.\\n [We see Steve holding a compass with an image of Peggy Carter.]\\n STEVE ROGERS: Cause I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do if it doesn\\'t.\\n [Carol Danvers approaches the Benatar.]\\n CAROL DANVERS: No satellites, no ships, no armies, no ground defenses of any kind. It\\'s just him.\\n NEBULA: And that\\'s enough.\\n [Cut to a shot of a scenic lush tropical fauna. It surrounds a shed on a farm. A scarecrow made of Thanos\\' armour is seen before we cut to a shot focusing on the burnt Infinity Gauntlet on Thanos\\' arm. He\\'s walking among his crops, harvesting fruit, and putting them in a sack. He walks over to the shed, with a dragging quality to his legs, like it pains him to walk, presumably his living quarters, and tries to sit down, and we see his full face. His whole left side is burnt black with blisters; He looks ridiculously pathetic compared to when we saw him last.]\\n [Suddenly, Carol Danvers flies through the roof, knocking Thanos down, and grabbing his neck. Bruce in the Hulkbuster armor bursts from the ground, and grabs Thanos\\' Infinity Gauntlet arm. Thor flies in and slices off the Infinity Gauntlet. Rhodey flies down with Rocket and aims guns on Thanos\\' head.]\\n [Captain America walks in his Winter Soldier Outfit, with Natasha right behind him, staring murderously at Thanos. Rocket goes over to the sliced off Infinity Gauntlet, and kicks it over, as everyone realizes that there are no stones in it.]\\n ROCKET: Oh no.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Where are they?\\n CAROL DANVERS: Answer the question!\\n THANOS: The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose, beyond temptation.\\n BRUCE BANNER: You murdered trillions! [Bruce pushes him to the ground wearing Hulk Buster armor]\\n THANOS: You should be grateful. [Punched by Hulk Buster]\\n NATASHA ROMANONFF: Where are the Stones?\\n THANOS: Gone. Reduced to atoms.\\n BRUCE BANNER: You used them two days ago!\\n THANOS: I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be. [sits himself a little straighter.] I am... inevitable.\\n RHODEY: We have to tear this place apart, he-he-he has to be lying.\\n NEBULA: My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.\\n THANOS: Ah, thank you, daughter. [Nebula looks down, a little uncomfortable.] Perhaps I treated you too harshly.\\n [We see Thor\\'s face filled with rage as he raises to summon Stormbreaker, and before anyone can stop him, SLICES Thanos\\' head off. Thanos\\' limp body falls to the floor. Nebula wipes off some of the blood spatter.]\\n ROCKET: What... What did you do?\\n [Thor looks broken, realizing what he has done.]\\n THOR: I went for the head.\\n [Thor slowly walks out of the shed, no real purpose in his steps as the screen blurs to nothingness.]\\n FIVE\\n [A pause]\\n YEARS\\n [pause]\\n LATER\\n [We see shots of New York City, seemingly abandoned. There are a lot of boats gathered around a dock, all abandoned. A baseball stadium comes into view, with no life present at all. The aftermath of the Decimation is evident, and Earth has not coped well.]\\n [Cut to an abandoned cafe, with a poster on the wall labeled \"WHERE DO WE GO, NOW THAT THEY\\'RE GONE?\". A therapy session is taking place with Steve Rogers and seven other people.]\\n JOE RUSSO: So I, uh... Went on a date the other day. It\\'s the first time in five years, you know? I\\'m sitting there at dinner... I didn\\'t even know what to talk about.\\n STEVE ROGERS: What did you talk about?\\n JOE RUSSO: Same old crap, you know? How things have changed, and... my job, his job... How much we miss the Mets. And then things get quiet... He cried as they were serving the salads.\\n JIM STARLIN: What about you?\\n JOE RUSSO: I cried... just before dessert. But I\\'m seeing him again tomorrow, so...\\n STEVE ROGERS: That\\'s great. You did the hardest part. You took the jump, you didn\\'t know where you were gonna come down. And that\\'s it. That\\'s those little brave baby steps we gotta take. To try and become whole again, try and find purpose. I went in the ice in \\'45 right after I met the love of my life. Woke up 70 years later. You gotta move on. Gotta to move on. The world is in our hands. It\\'s left to us guys, and we got to do something with it. Otherwise... Thanos should have killed all of us.\\n [Screen Title: SAN FRANCISCO]\\n (The camera pans to San Francisco Bridge, all the way to a self-storage facility with a sign saying \"U-STORE It, SELF STORAGE\", with its interior filled with stored stuff and junk until it spots Luis\\' van from \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\", behind a metallic fence with a label named \"LANG\". A rat crawls over the van\\'s rear windshield and accidentally activates the controls for opening the Quantum Realm, haphazardly activating the Quantum Tunnel. The rear door busts open, flinging Lang outside the van.)\\n SCOTT LANG: (grunts as he pushes away a cushion out of his body, and deactivates the helmet, but still grunting in pain, as he sweeps away sparks from an electrical failure out of his suit, then try to stand up.) What the hell?\\n (He manages to stand up, as another electrical failure sparks out of his gauntlets, and now looks around in a confused look.)\\n SCOTT LANG: Hope?\\n (Inside a security office, a security guard (Ken Jeong) reading a book as he looks upon his security screen, seeing something going on in one of the storage facilities. In the cameras, it shows Lang in his casual clothing, shouting, waving a sign with the word \"HELP\" written on it.)\\n (Outside the facility, he pulls out a pushcart and looks back seeing the guard giving a stern look from far. He walks around until reaching his hometown, finding a post filled with MISSING posters, abandoned houses, a wrecked car, nothing but desolation. He then sees a kid in a bike pass by.)\\n SCOTT LANG: [yells] Kid! Hey kid!\\n [The kid stops his bike as he stares back in a serious look.]\\n SCOTT LANG: What the hell happened here?\\n [The kid still stares at him and is almost about to tear up, but immediately turns away from him and move on. Lang still gives the same confused look, as he arrives in somewhat a memorial called \"THE VANISHED\", with all the names of the people who became victims of the Decimation. As Lang arrives on one of the engraved stones, he immediately drops the handle in shock.]\\n SCOTT LANG: No. Please. Please, please. [moves on to check the other side of the engraved stone] No, no, no. No. [Lang excuses aside a young couple as he keeps on checking another engraved stone if his daughter\\'s name is on one.] Excuse me, sorry. No, Cassie, no.\\n [The camera keeps panning and switching as Lang checks the rest of engraved stones if her daughter\\'s name was in one.]\\n SCOTT LANG: [in a mantra-like] Please, please, please, please... No, Cassie. [Lang looks at the engraved stone in shock, revealing his name in it.]\\n SCOTT LANG: What?\\n [Scott is now seen running across the memorial, then to his hometown, only to ring a doorbell at his house, bang on the door, and try opening the door, but is found locked. Then, he sees a feminine figure appear out of a hallway inside. The figure gets closer, revealing a woman in a purple sweater, with her hand pushing towards the glass door\\'s window, and her face filled with amazement, as she unlocked the door. It was Lang\\'s daughter, Cassie, now a grown-up teen since the last five years.]\\n [Cassie, who hasn\\'t seen him for five years, holds up his face in an emotional sight and starts to smile tearfully. Lang does the same.]\\n SCOTT LANG: Cassie?\\n CASSIE LANG: Dad? [Both of them emotionally hug each other as both dad and daughter had reunited. Then Lang shoves her back, realizing that her daughter is now a full-grown teenager.]\\n SCOTT LANG: You\\'re so big!\\n [Both dad and daughter share a hug once more.]\\n [The camera cuts to a sunset in San Francisco, showing a metal face with a sign saying in its headings, \"RESTRICTED AREA, DO NOT ENTER\" with the subtext, \"AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY BEYOND THIS POINT, SECURITY ID OR ESCORT REQUIRED\", then cuts to a scene inside the New Avengers facility, someone cutting the two bread with peanut butter filling into a couple of triangles, as someone else was speaking. The camera pans up to Romanoff, now having red, long hair, over-colouring her blonde streaks, hearing Rocket Raccoon out about his status so far.]\\n ROCKET: Yeah, we boarded that highly suspect warship Danvers pinged.\\n [The camera cuts showing a few of the Avengers in holographic calls from the left to right, respectively: Nebula and Rocket Raccoon, Okoye, Danvers with a tomboyish haircut, and Rhodes.]\\n NEBULA: It was an infectious garbage scowl.\\n ROCKET: So, thanks for the hot tip. [turns to Danvers and replies back with a smirk]\\n CAROL DANVERS: Well, you were closer.\\n ROCKET: Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: [turns to Okoye] You get a reading on those tremors?\\n OKOYE: It was a mild subduction under the African plate.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Do we have a visual? How are we handling it?\\n OKOYE: Nat, it\\'s an earthquake under the ocean. We handle it by not handling it.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: [turns to Danvers] Carol, are we seeing you here next month?\\n CAROL DANVERS: Not likely.\\n ROCKET: What, you gonna get another haircut?\\n CAROL DANVERS: [irritated] Listen fur-face, I\\'m covering a lot of territory. The things that are happening on Earth, are happening everywhere, on thousands of planets.\\n ROCKET: [murmurs to himself] All right, all right, that\\'s a good point. That\\'s a good point.\\n CAROL DANVERS: So you might not see me for a long time.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Alright. Uh, well. This channel is always active. So, if anything goes sideways... anyone\\'s making trouble where they shouldn\\'t... comes through me.\\n [Okoye agrees in her language.]\\n ROCKET: Okay.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Alright.\\n [The Avengers cut off their calls one by one...]\\n CAROL DANVERS: [To Rhodey] Good luck. [cuts off call]\\n [Except for Rhodes. Nat sighs exhausted, and sits down, as she notices Rhodes still online in the call.]\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Where are you?\\n RHODEY: Mexico. The Federales found a room full of bodies. Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never even had the chance to get their guns off.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: It\\'s probably a rival gang.\\n RHODEY: Except it isn\\'t. (Nat realizes something.) It\\'s definitely Barton. What he\\'s done here, what he\\'s been doing for the last few years... I mean, the scene that he left... (Nat starts to show signs of sadness as she gradually tears up.) I gotta tell you, there\\'s a part of me that doesn\\'t even want to find him.\\n (In an abrupt moment of silence, she tries to chew her tears and emotional feelings as she eats a sandwich.)\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Will you find out where he\\'s going next?\\n RHODEY: Nat...\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Please.\\n RHODEY: [reluctantly] Okay. [then Rhodes cuts off his]\\n [Nat starts to cry as she tries to hold back her tears miserably.]\\n STEVE ROGERS: You know I\\'d offer to cook you dinner but you seem pretty miserable already. [Out of nowhere, Roger slumps over a bookshelf, in the same mood as he is in the therapy session, as Nat wipes off the tears off her face.]\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: You here to do your laundry?\\n STEVE ROGERS: And to see a friend.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Clearly, your friend is fine.\\n STEVE ROGERS: You know I saw a pod of whales when I was coming up the bridge.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: In the Hudson?\\n STEVE ROGERS: There\\'s fewer ships, cleaner water.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: You know, if you\\'re about to tell me to look on the bright side. Um... I\\'m about you to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich. [jokingly smiles, as Rogers does the same]\\n STEVE ROGERS: Sorry. Force of habit. [Throws his jacket, then sits down on another chair, opposite Natasha.]\\n STEVE ROGERS: You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on and... grow. Some do. But not us.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: If I move on, who does this?\\n STEVE ROGERS: Maybe it doesn\\'t need to be done.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: [Deep in her thoughts] I used to have nothing. And then I got this. This job... this family. And I was... I was better because of it. And even though... they\\'re gone... I\\'m still trying to be better.\\n STEVE ROGERS: I think we both need to get a life.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: [Smiling] You first.\\n [A camera footage pops up in front of them, showing Scott Lang with his Quantum Realm Van behind him.]\\n SCOTT LANG: Oh! Hi. Hi! Is anyone home? This is Scott Lang. We met a few years ago, at the airport? In Germany? I got really big, and I had my mask on. You wouldn\\'t recognize me.\\n STEVE ROGERS: [Standing up] Is this an old message?\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: [Also standing up] It\\'s the front gate.\\n SCOTT LANG: Ant-Man? Ant-Man, I know you know that. I need to talk to you guys.\\n [Cut to Scott inside the Avengers Compound, pacing worriedly in front of Steve and Natasha.]\\n STEVE ROGERS: Scott. Are you okay?\\n SCOTT LANG: Yeah. I\\'m fine.\\n [He struggles to ask about something. He finally blurts it out.]\\n SCOTT LANG: Have you ever studied Quantum Physics?\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Only to make conversation.\\n SCOTT LANG: Alright. So... five years ago, right before Thanos, I was in a place called the Quantum Realm. The Quantum Realm is like its own microscopic universe. To get in there, you have to be incredibly small. Hope, she\\'s my... She was my... [struggling to not tell the entire truth about their relationship] She was supposed to pull me out. And then Thanos happened, and I got stuck in there.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: I\\'m sorry. That must\\'ve been a very long five years.\\n SCOTT LANG: Yeah, but that\\'s just it. It wasn\\'t. For me, it was five hours.\\n [Steve and Nat share a quick bewildered glance.]\\n SCOTT LANG: See, the rules of the Quantum Realm aren\\'t like they are up here. Everything is unpredictable. Is that anybody\\'s sandwich? I\\'m starving.\\n [He strides over to pick up Nat\\'s sandwich, and bites into it.]\\n STEVE ROGERS: Scott, what are you talking about?\\n SCOTT LANG: What I\\'m saying is, time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem is right now, we don\\'t have a way to navigate it. But what if we did? I can\\'t stop thinking about it. What if, we could somehow control the chaos, and we could navigate it? What if there was a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time but then exit at another point in time? Like... Like before Thanos.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Wait, are you talking about a time machine?\\n SCOTT LANG: No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine. It\\'s more like a... Yeah, a time machine. I know it\\'s crazy. But I can\\'t stop thinking about it. There\\'s gotta be some way... There\\'s gotta be...some w... it\\'s crazy.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Scott, I get e-mails from a raccoon, so nothing sounds crazy anymore.\\n SCOTT LANG: So who do we talk to about this?\\n [We cut to a cabin in the woods, at the bank of a lake. We see Tony Stark sitting outside what looks like a tiny shed.]\\n TONY STARK: [Clapping his hand in a famous beat. Clap! Clap! Clap-Clap-Clap! Clap-Clap-Clap-Clap!] Chow time! [He seems to be speaking to someone unknown by the audience.] Maguna? Morgan H. Stark. You want some lunch?\\n MORGAN STARK: Define lunch or be disintegrated. [She puts on a silver and blue helmet similar to Iron Man\\'s]\\n (A girl with long dark hair walks out in front of Tony. This is Morgan Stark, Tony and Pepper\\'s daughter. She looks to be about 3 & 4 years of age.)\\n TONY STARK: Okay, You should not be wearing that, okay? That is part of a special anniversary gift I\\'m making for Mom. (Takes the helmet off Morgan\\'s head. She emerges out smiling mischievously.)\\n MORGAN STARK: Okay.\\n TONY STARK: There you go. Are you thinking about lunch? I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.\\n MORGAN STARK: No.\\n TONY STARK: That\\'s what you want. How did you find this?\\n MORGAN STARK: Garage.\\n TONY STARK: Really? Were you looking for it?\\n MORGAN STARK: No. I found it, though.\\n TONY STARK: You like going to the garage, huh? So does daddy. It\\'s fine, actually. Your mom never wears anything I buy her.\\n (They start walking towards the house, but Tony notices a black Audi pulling coming to a stop a few meters away. Steve, Nat, and Scott get out of the car. Tony sighs. He is not looking forward to the discussion about to take place.)\\n SCOTT LANG: (Cut to after Scott\\'s plan has been explained to Tony) Now, we know what it sounds like...\\n STEVE ROGERS: Tony, after everything you\\'ve seen, is anything really impossible?\\n TONY STARK: Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition. Can we agree on that?\\n (Scott, Steve and Nat all look puzzled. Science is barely any of their fields.)\\n STEVE ROGERS: (Tony giving a drink to him.) Thank you.\\n TONY STARK: In Layman\\'s terms, it means you\\'re not coming home.\\n SCOTT LANG: I did.\\n TONY STARK: No, you accidentally survived. It\\'s a billion to one cosmic fluke. And now you wanna pull off a... What do you call it?\\n SCOTT LANG: (Trying to hide his pride) A time heist?\\n TONY STARK: Yeah, a time heist. Of course, why didn\\'t we think of this before? Oh, because it\\'s laughable? Because it\\'s a pipedream?\\n SCOTT LANG: The Stones are in the past. We can go back and get them.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everyone back.\\n TONY STARK: Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?\\n STEVE ROGERS: I don\\'t believe we would.\\n TONY STARK: Gotta say, sometimes I miss that giddy optimism. However, high hopes won\\'t help if there\\'s no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist. I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise.\\n SCOTT LANG: Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. That means no talking to our past selves, no betting on sporting events -\\n TONY STARK: I\\'m gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on Back To The Future?\\n SCOTT LANG: [embarrassed] No.\\n TONY STARK: Good. You had me worried there. \\'Cause that\\'d be horse shit. That\\'s not how quantum physics works.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Tony... We have to take a stand.\\n TONY STARK: We did stand. And yet, here we are.\\n SCOTT LANG: I know you got a lot on the line. You got a wife, a daughter. But I lost someone very important to me. A lot of people did. [His voice gets louder as he tries to sell his desperation to Tony.] And now, now we have a chance to bring her back. To bring everyone back. And you\\'re telling me that won\\'t even...\\n TONY STARK: That\\'s right, Scott, I won\\'t even. I got a kid.\\n [Morgan runs to her dad, who picks her up.]\\n MORGAN STARK: Mommy told me to come and save you.\\n TONY STARK: Good job. I\\'m saved. [Turning to face Cap, Nat and Scott.] I wish you\\'d come here to ask me something else. Anything else. Honestly, I... I missed you guys, it was... Oh, and table\\'s set for six.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Tony, I get it. And I\\'m happy for you, I really am. But this is a second chance.\\n TONY STARK: I got my second chance right here, Cap. I can\\'t roll the dice again. If you don\\'t talk shop, you can stay for lunch.\\n [We see Cap, Nat and Scott walking back to their car outside Tony\\'s house.]\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: He\\'s scared.\\n STEVE ROGERS: He\\'s not wrong.\\n SCOTT LANG: Yeah, but I mean, what are we gonna do? We need him. What, are we gonna stop?\\n STEVE ROGERS: No, I wanna do it right. We\\'re gonna need a really big brain.\\n SCOTT LANG: (Incredulous, pointing to Tony\\'s house) Bigger than his?\\n [Cut to a cafe somewhere, we see Bruce Banner, but not the same one that we remember. He looks more... Professor Smart Hulk.]\\n BRUCE BANNER: Come on, I feel like I\\'m the only one eating. [Pushing a plate forward] Try some of that. Have some eggs.\\n SCOTT LANG: I\\'m so confused.\\n BRUCE BANNER: [seriously] These are confusing times.\\n SCOTT LANG: Right. No, no, that\\'s not what I meant.\\n BRUCE BANNER: [dropping the act] No, I get it. I\\'m kidding! I know. It\\'s crazy. I\\'m wearing shirts now.\\n SCOTT LANG: Yeah! Wh...How? Why?\\n BRUCE BANNER: Five years ago, we got our asses beaten. Except it was worse for me. Because I lost twice. First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost. Then, we all lost.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: No one blamed you, Bruce.\\n BRUCE BANNER: I did. For years, I\\'ve been treating the Hulk like he\\'s some kind of disease, something to get rid of. But then I started looking at him as the cure. Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Best of both worlds...\\n [Three children behind Bruce walk up to him tentatively]\\n GIRL: Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?\\n BRUCE BANNER: Yes?\\n GIRL: Can we get a photo?\\n BRUCE BANNER: 100%, little person. Come on, step up. [Holding out the phone to Scott] You mind?\\n SCOTT LANG: Oh, yeah.\\n BRUCE BANNER: Thanks, [To the Children] Say \"green\"! [The children and Bruce say Green as Scott snaps the photo.]\\n BRUCE BANNER: Did you get that?\\n SCOTT LANG: [leaning forward to hand back the phone] Don\\'t you wanna grab one with me? I\\'m Ant-Man.\\n SCOTT LANG: They\\'re Hulk fans, they don\\'t know Ant-Man. Nobody does.\\n BRUCE BANNER: Wait, no, no, he feels bad. No, he wants you to...he wants to...[to one of the boys] You want to take a picture with him, right? [The boy shakes his head vigorously.]\\n BOY: Stranger Danger.\\n SCOTT LANG: He\\'s even saying no he doesn\\'t. I get it. I don\\'t want it either.\\n BRUCE BANNER: But, come on, the kid! But he...but you...\\n SCOTT LANG: I don\\'t want a picture with them.\\n BRUCE BANNER: [To the children] He\\'s gonna feel bad. [To Scott] Sorry. They said they\\'d do it.\\n SCOTT LANG: I don\\'t want it anymore.\\n BRUCE BANNER: No, no...you feel bad.\\n SCOTT LANG: Just take the goddamn phone.\\n [Maybe next time, Scott.]\\n GIRL: Thank you, Mr. Hulk.\\n BRUCE BANNER: No, it\\'s great kids. Thank you very much. [Same time with kids] Hulk out!\\n STEVE ROGERS: Bruce.\\n BRUCE BANNER: [Awkwardly] Dab!\\n STEVE ROGERS: Bruce.\\n BRUCE BANNER: Listen to your Mom. She knows better.\\n STEVE ROGERS: About we were saying...\\n BRUCE BANNER: Right. The whole time travel do-over? Guys, it\\'s outside my area of expertise.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Well, you pulled this off. I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible time, too.\\n [The scene cuts to Tony Stark in the kitchen washing dishes after dinner. As he finishes the last of them, stumbles upon a photo of both Stark and Parker, with Parker holding his Stark Internship certificate. Tony finally knows what he\\'s fighting for.]\\n [Cut to Tony talking to his computer, generating a holographic model of something he\\'s working on.]\\n TONY STARK: Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what check out. So, recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a mobius strip, inverted, please.\\n F.R.I.D.A.Y: Processing...\\n TONY STARK: Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. That will take a second.\\n F.R.I.D.A.Y: Just a moment.\\n TONY STARK: And don\\'t worry if it doesn\\'t pan out. I\\'m just kinda -\\n F.R.I.D.A.Y: Model rendered.\\n [In a complete shock of amazement, the render comes back as 99.987% successful. Tony falls back, bewildered by this discovery.]\\n TONY STARK: Shit!\\n MORGAN STARK: Shit.\\n [Morgan, who has been hiding behind him all this time, giggles as she repeats the word Tony just uttered.]\\n TONY STARK: [Whispering] What are you doing up, little mess?\\n MORGAN STARK: Shit.\\n TONY STARK: No, we don\\'t say that. Only Mommy says that word. She coined it, it belongs to her.\\n MORGAN STARK: Why you up?\\n TONY STARK: \\'Cause I got some important shit going on here. [Morgan gives Tony a taste of the incredulous] What do you think? No, I got something on my mind. I got something on my mind.\\n MORGAN STARK: Was it Juice Pops?\\n TONY STARK: Sure was. That\\'s extortion. Great minds think alike. Juice Pops, exactly was on... [Looks back to the model, Then turns back] my mind.\\n [In Morgan\\'s room]\\n TONY STARK: You done? Yeah, now you are. [Tony wipes Morgan\\'s lips and pushes her head onto her pillow] That face goes there.\\n MORGAN STARK: Tell me a story.\\n TONY STARK: A story... Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end.\\n MORGAN STARK: [Giggling] That\\'s a horrible story.\\n TONY STARK: Come on, that\\'s your favorite story. I love you tons. [Kisses Morgan on the forehead.]\\n MORGAN STARK: I love you 3000.\\n TONY STARK: [Silently] Wow. [Turns off the lamp] 3000. That\\'s crazy. [Closed the door] Go to bed. Or I\\'ll sell all your toys. Night, night.\\n [Cut to the living room where Pepper is reading a book sitting on the couch. Tony paces in front of the fireplace.]\\n TONY STARK: Not that it\\'s a competition, but she loves me 3000. You were somewhere on the low 6 to 900 range. [Pepper scoffs]\\n TONY STARK: [Absentmindedly] What are you reading?\\n PEPPER POTTS: Oh, it\\'s just a book on composting.\\n TONY STARK: [Still absentmindedly] What\\'s new with composting?\\n PEPPER POTTS: Just -\\n TONY STARK: I figured it out, by the way.\\n PEPPER POTTS: You know, just so we\\'re talking about the same thing -\\n TONY STARK: Time travel.\\n PEPPER POTTS: [Amazed] What? Wow... That\\'s amazing, and... terrifying.\\n TONY STARK: That\\'s right.\\n PEPPER POTTS: We got really lucky.\\n TONY STARK: Yeah, I know.\\n PEPPER POTTS: A lot of people didn\\'t.\\n TONY STARK: No, I can\\'t help everybody.\\n PEPPER POTTS: It sort a seems like you can.\\n TONY STARK: Not if I stop. I can put a pin in it right now, and stop.\\n PEPPER POTTS: Tony, trying to get you to stop has been one of the few failures of my life.\\n [Tony smiles]\\n TONY STARK: I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake... go to bed.\\n PEPPER POTTS: But would you be able to rest?\\n [Cut to a lab in the Avengers Compound, we see Bruce fiddling with buttons on a panel. Scott is in his Ant-Man costume in front of his van, with the back open to show the Quantum Tunnel. Nat and Steve are beside Bruce]\\n BRUCE BANNER: Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one. Scott, fire up the uhhh... the van thing.\\n [Scott opens the portal]\\n STEVE ROGERS: Breakers are set, emergency generators are on standby.\\n BRUCE BANNER: Good. \\'Cause if we blow the grid, I don\\'t wanna lose Tiny here in the 1950\\'s. [Scott, Nat and Cap give Bruce a panicked look]\\n SCOTT LANG: Excuse me?\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: He\\'s kidding. [In a hushed tone to Bruce] You can\\'t say things like that!\\n BRUCE BANNER: Just... It was a bad joke.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: You were kidding, right?\\n BRUCE BANNER: [Whispering to Nat] I have no idea. We\\'re talking about time travel here. Either it\\'s all a joke, or none of it is. [Loudly and gives Scott a thumbs up] We\\'re good! Get your helmet on, Scott. I\\'m gonna send you back a week, let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds. Makes sense?\\n SCOTT LANG: Perfectly not confusing\\n STEVE ROGERS: Good luck, Scott. You got this.\\n SCOTT LANG: You\\'re right. I do, Captain America.\\n [Bruce presses a button, and Scott disappears into the Quantum Tunnel.]\\n BRUCE BANNER: On the count of three. 3... 2... 1!\\n [Bruce presses a button, and someone in the Ant-Man suit comes back. A teenager in appears out of it.]\\n TEEN SCOTT LANG: Uh, guys? This...this doesn\\'t feel right.\\n STEVE ROGERS: What is this?\\n BRUCE BANNER: What\\'s going on?\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: That...who is that?\\n [He pushes another couple of buttons, trying to fix the problem.] \\n BRUCE BANNER: Hold on. [Panicking]\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Is that Scott?\\n TEEN SCOTT LANG: Yes, it\\'s Scott!\\n [Teen Scott gets sucked in back into the quantum tunnel, and it appears to be an old man in the Ant-Man suit.]\\n OLD SCOTT LANG: Ow! My back!\\n STEVE ROGERS: What is this?\\n BRUCE BANNER: Can I get a little space here.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Yeah yeah. Can you bring him back?\\n BRUCE BANNER: I\\'m working on it! [Tapping the side of the button pad, trying to pull back Scott]\\n [After a moment, another person appears in front of them. This time, it\\'s a baby in the Ant-Man suit.]\\n STEVE ROGERS: It\\'s a baby. [seriously?]\\n BRUCE BANNER: It\\'s Scott.\\n STEVE ROGERS: As a baby!\\n BRUCE BANNER: He\\'ll grow.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Bring Scott back!\\n BRUCE BANNER: [motioning to Nat] When I say kill the power, kill the power.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Oh my god. [rapidly walk near to the generator]\\n BRUCE BANNER: And... Kill it!\\n [Nat pulls down a lever, and everything shuts down. Scott, the normal Scott, gets spewed back out again.]\\n SCOTT LANG: Somebody peed my pants.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Oh thank god.\\n SCOTT LANG: But I don\\'t know if it was \"baby\" me or \"old\" me...Or just \"me\" me.\\n BRUCE BANNER: [holds up his his hands in a dramatic way] Time travel!\\n [Steve says nothing. He simply shakes his head and walks away]\\n BRUCE BANNER: What? I..I see this as an absolute win!\\n [We cut to see Steve sitting outside the Avengers Compound, staring at the floor, deep in thought. He looks beat, the only possibility of victory now not an opportunity. He looks up as a deafening noise breaks the silence in the distance. As he looks, we see an Audi R8 speeding towards the entrance. The car pulls over to Cap, but goes a bit too far, then reverses to Cap. We see Tony Stark roll down the window and look at Cap.]\\n TONY STARK: Why the long face? Let me guess: He turned into a baby.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?\\n [He gets out of the car, and walks around to the back.]\\n TONY STARK: [Ignoring Steve\\'s question] That\\'s the EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might\\'ve wound up pushing time through Lang. It\\'s tricky. Dangerous. Somebody should\\'ve cautioned you against it.\\n STEVE ROGERS: You did.\\n TONY STARK: Oh, did I? [acting like he did not; there\\'s the Tony we know] Thank God I\\'m here. Regardless, I fixed it. [He holds up his right hand, with a device on it] A fully functioning Time-Space GPS. I just want peace. [Makes peace sign with his fingers] Turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Me too.\\n TONY STARK: We got a shot at getting these stones, but I gotta tell you my priorities: Bring back what we lost? I hope, yes. Keep what I got? I have to, at all costs. And... maybe not die trying will be nice.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Sounds like a deal. [Steve reaches out his hand to shake in the deal, in which Tony replies in the same way.] \\n [Tony reaches back into his trunk to pull something else out, Captain America\\'s Shield. He makes to give it to Steve, who hesitates.]\\n STEVE ROGERS: Tony...\\n TONY STARK: Why? He made it for you. [referring to Howard Stark] Plus, honestly I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.\\n [Steve fits his arm into the shield.]\\n STEVE ROGERS: Thank you, Tony.\\n TONY STARK: Will you keep that a little quiet? Didn\\'t bring one for the whole team. [Hesitates] ...We are getting the whole team, yeah?\\n STEVE ROGERS: We\\'re working on that right now.\\n [Cut to the Benatar landing in the yard of the Avenger\\'s Compound. Scott is sitting having a Taco and some Nachos at a bench, and everything falls out of the taco as the Benatar lands. Nebula and Rocket walk out of the ship, and past Scott.]\\n ROCKET: Hey, humie! Where\\'s Big Green?\\n SCOTT LANG: Uh, Kitchen, I think. [To himself as he sees Nebula] That\\'s awesome.\\n NEBULA: [into an earpiece] Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There\\'s an idiot on the landing zone.\\n [She walks away. Moments later, just as Scott is getting back to his senses, Rhodey lands right in front of him without warning. This time Scott is so surprised, he drops the whole taco.]\\n SCOTT LANG: Oh, God!\\n RHODEY: What\\'s up, regular sized man?\\n [As Rhodey walks away, Bruce walks out of the Compound. Seeing that Scott dropped his lunch, he hands two tacos from his own lunch to Scott. Scott takes it while giving Bruce a puzzling look at this act of kindness.]\\n [Song \"My Supersonic Ship\" plays in the background. Cut to Bruce sitting at the back of a Utility car as they traverse the green countryside of Norway. They pass a sign labelled \"WELCOME TO NEW ASGARD, PLEASE DRIVE SLOWLY.\". They stop at a small town on a port. Bruce and Rocket get out of the car, and look around at the remaining Asgardians, living like normal humans at a port.]\\n ROCKET: Kind of a step down from a from a golden palace for an Avenger highness and whatnot.\\n BRUCE BANNER: Hey, have a little compassion, pal. First they\\'ve lost Asgard, then half the people. They\\'re probably just happy to have a home. [Bruce spots Valkyrie looking over at him, and heads over to her.]\\n VALKYRIE: You shouldn\\'t have come!\\n BRUCE BANNER: Ah, Valkyrie! Great to see you, Angry Girl.\\n VALKYRIE: [Noticing Bruce\\'s change of appearance] I think I liked you better either of the other ways.\\n BRUCE BANNER: [motioning to Rocket] This is Rocket.\\n ROCKET: How you doin\\'?\\n VALKYRIE: [Eyeing Rocket] He won\\'t see you.\\n BRUCE BANNER: That bad, huh?\\n VALKYRIE: We only see him once a month, when he comes for... [looking over to a pile of kegs of stout and other beer on the side] ... supplies.\\n BRUCE BANNER: It\\'s that bad.\\n VALKYRIE: Yeah.\\n [Cut to Rocket opening a door, and him and Bruce walking through it.]\\n ROCKET: [Grimacing at the smell] What the...  Woo! Something died in here.\\n BRUCE BANNER: Hello? Thor?\\n THOR: [From another room.] Are you here about the cable?\\n [He walks into view, and the audience\\'s jaw drops. Thor, who is shirtless, has definitely put on more than a couple of pounds since we saw him last.]\\n THOR: The Cinemax ran out about two weeks ago, and the sports were all kind of fuzzy. [He grabs a beer]\\n BRUCE BANNER: Thor?\\n [He notices Bruce and Rocket standing there. He cracks into joy.] BOYS! Oh my God! Its so to see you! [To Rocket, trying to hug him] Come here, you little rascal! [growling]\\n ROCKET: No, I\\'m good. I\\'m good. That\\'s not necessary.\\n THOR: Hulk, you know my friends, Miek, Korg, right?\\n [We see Miek and Korg sitting on a couch, PlayStation controller in hand, playing Fortnite and eating chips.]\\n KORG:\\xa0Hey boys!\\n BRUCE BANNER: Hey guys, long time no see.\\n KORG: Beer\\'s on the bucket. Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi. No password, obviously. [He goes back to his game.] Thor, he\\'s back. The kid on the TV that called me a dickhead again.\\n THOR: NoobMaster.\\n KORG: Yeah, NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead.\\n [Thor walks over to Korg, takes his headphones, and speaks into the mic.]\\n THOR: Noobmaster? Yeah, it\\'s Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder? Listen, buddy. If you don\\'t log off this game immediately, I am gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you\\'re hiding in, rip off your arms AND SHOVE THEM UP YOUR BUTT!!! Oh, that\\'s right. Yes, go cry to your father, you little weasel!\\n KORG: [Thor brings his headphones back] Thank you, Thor.\\n THOR: Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?\\n KORG: Thank you very much. I will.\\n THOR: So you guys want a drink? What are you drinking? We have beer, tequila, all sorts of things.\\n [Thor uses Stormbreaker to open a bottle of beer and starts drinking. Bruce walks to him and places a hand on his shoulder]\\n BRUCE BANNER: Buddy, you all right?\\n THOR: \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bYes, I\\'m fine! Why, don\\'t I look all right?\\n ROCKET: [Concerned] You look like melted ice cream.\\n THOR: [Laughs] So, what\\'s up?\\n BRUCE BANNER: We need your help. There might be a chance we could fix everything.\\n THOR: What, like the cable? [burps] Cause that\\'s been driving me bananas for weeks.\\n BRUCE BANNER: Like Thanos.\\n [Thor\\'s smile slowly disappears. He puts a shaky hand on Bruce\\'s shoulder and points at him.]\\n THOR: Don\\'t say that name.\\n [Korg stands up and takes off his headphones]\\n KORG: Um, yeah. We don\\'t actually say that name in here.\\n BRUCE BANNER: [quietly] Please take your hand off me. [He brushes away Thor\\'s hand] Now, I know that... guy might scare you.\\n THOR: Why would I be? Why would, why would I be scared of that guy? I\\'m the one who killed that guy, remember? Anyone else here killed that guy? Nope. Didn\\'t think so. Korg, why don\\'t you, tell everybody who chopped Thanos\\' big head off.\\n [Thor walks off screen]\\n KORG: Umm... Stormbreaker?\\n THOR: Now, who\\'s swingin\\' Stormbreaker?\\n BRUCE BANNER: I get it. You\\'re in a rough spot, okay? I\\'ve been there myself. You wanna know who helped me out of it?\\n THOR: I don\\'t know. Is it... Natasha?\\n BRUCE BANNER: It was you. You helped me.\\n THOR: [walks over and looks out the window and points, still holding his beer] Why don\\'t you ask the, Asgardians down there, how much my help was worth. [he drops onto the sofa] The ones that are left, anyway.\\n BRUCE BANNER: I think we can bring them back.\\n THOR: Stop. stop, okay? [opens a packet on M&Ms] I know you think I\\'m down here wallowing in my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and and saved. But I\\'m fine, okay? We\\'re fine, aren\\'t we?\\n [The camera cuts to Korg and Miek eating pizza and playing once more]\\n KORG: Nah, all good here, mate.\\n [Cuts back to Thor]\\n THOR: So, whatever it is that you\\'re offering, we\\'re not into it, don\\'t care, couldn\\'t care less. Goodbye.\\n BRUCE BANNER: [from offscreen] We need you, pal.\\n [Thor shakes his head and ignores Bruce.]\\n ROCKET: [Crossing his arms] There\\'s beer on the ship.\\n THOR: [pauses, but doesn\\'t look up then puts the bottle down] What kind?\\n [SCREEN TITLE: TOKYO]\\n [After seeing a Quinjet flown to the capital, the scene cuts to a nightclub in the city of Tokyo, as the entertainment still intact, loads of dead bodies of yakuza members are seen as a hooded figure throws a shuriken at another yakuza member firing at him. They are shouting something in Japanese, as two more men come out of nowhere and draw out their UZIs.]\\n THUG #1: あいつだ! アキヒコさんを！(Romanized: Aitsu da! Akihiko-san wo!) (Translated: It\\'s him! He\\'s after Akihiko!)\\n [Both thugs fire their SMGs as both got slain by a shuriken. A yakuza member wielding a katana charges at him in the stairs, but is immediately overthrown and slain by the Ronin. Ronin then fights another sword-wielding thug, which is thrown outside the glass, killing him. The camera passes through two more buildings as the fighting ensues with different screams, shouts, more havoc inside, and gunfire. A man in a dark raincoat jumps through the glass window, with the Ronin doing the same, as both of them lands in a dark alleyway. The man in the raincoat turns to the Ronin, who just landed after him. It was Akihiko, the leader of a yakuza gang, whose head being hunted by the Ronin himself.]\\n AKIHIKO: てめえ なぜこんなことをする? 俺たちてめえになにもしてねぇだろ！(Romanized: Temē naze konna koto wo suru? Oretachi temē ni nani mo shitenē daro!) (English: Why are you doing this? We never did anything to you!)\\n RONIN: [As he draws out his katana and reversibly wields it.]地球の半分 サノスにやられた... お前はなぜ無事なの…(Romanized: Chikyū no hanbun sanosu ni yarareta... Omae wa naze buji nano...) (English: You survived... Half of the planet didn\\'t. They got Thanos... you get me.)\\n [Both sides engaged in combat as Ronin pierces his stomach, but doing only minor damage to him.]\\n RONIN: [Also in Japanese] お前はもう十分殺しただろ(Romanized:Omae mo jūbun korshita daro) You\\'re done hurting people.\\n AKIHIKO: [Japanese]俺らがだと? 気でも狂ったか! (Orera ga dato? Ki demo kurutta ka!) [he gestures to all the scattered bodies of his henchmen and chuckles] (English: WE hurt people? You\\'re crazy!)\\n [Akihiko charges, which Ronin immediately blocks. Both clang swords for two seconds, seeming that the yakuza leader has the upper hand, but Ronin punches him in the face, and sword-points him to his throat, in which Akihiko is temporarily petrified.]\\n [He lowers down his sword as if he is about to surrender, but charges again at Ronin. Both swords clashed as Ronin slices his stomach, losing stamina, but gaining more strength from his rage.]\\n AKIHIKO: [in a Gatotsu-like sword stance] 死ね! (Romanized: Shine!) (English: DIE!)\\n [They both draw their katanas and the sword-fight continues. Ronin is clearly a better fighter, but Akihiko is also quite experienced. They clang swords, and for a second, it looks like Akihiko has the upper hand swinging at Ronin\\'s neck. Ronin, however, ducks and slides under the katana, and slices Akihiko in the stomach as he slides past. Akihiko, now fatally injured, drops his katana.]\\n AKIHIKO: 待て! 助けてくれ! お前に何でもやる! 何が欲しい? (Romanized: Mate! Tasukete kure! Omae ni nan demo yaru! Nani ga hosī? (English: Wait! Help me! I\\'ll give you anything! What do you want?)\\n RONIN: [Raising his katana, in English] What I want... You can\\'t give me.\\n [He thrusts the blade downwards into Akihiko\\'s stomach. The body of the Japanese falls to the ground. Ronin grabs the sword, and wipes it on his gauntlet, ridding it of the blood of Akihiko. He notices someone behind him, and grabs his mask, and slides it off his head, revealing himself as Clint Barton, who has gone on a rampage since the decimation. He turns around and looks at Nat, who is standing behind him, holding an umbrella, and in casual clothes.]\\n CLINT BARTON: You shouldn\\'t be here.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Neither should you.\\n CLINT BARTON: I\\'ve got a job to do.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Is that what you\\'re calling this? Killing all these people isn\\'t gonna bring your family back.\\n [Clint starts to look emotional, on the verge of crying.]\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: We found something. A chance, maybe...\\n CLINT BARTON: [Now openly crying] Don\\'t...\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Don\\'t what?\\n CLINT BARTON: ...don\\'t give me hope.\\n NATASHA: I\\'m sorry I couldn\\'t give it to you sooner.\\n [We cut to the Avenger\\'s Compound, where we see Thor in a hoodie, drinking a beer and walking through the compound\\'s Testing Chamber. Tony is also there, walking in from behind Thor.]\\n TONY STARK: [To Thor] Drifting left. On the side there, Lebowski. [To Rocket, who\\'s working on something underneath a glass platform] Ratchet, How\\'s it going?\\n ROCKET: It\\'s Rocket. Take it easy. You\\'re only a genius on Earth, pal.\\n [Cut to a side room, where we see Scott, Bruce, Steve and Rhodey talking. Scott is in a white and red suit, similar to the Ant-Man suit.]\\n RHODEY: Time travel suit? Not bad.\\n SCOTT LANG: [Response to Hulk touching the suit and something red in a glass tube] Hey, hey, hey! Easy, easy!\\n BRUCE BANNER: I\\'m being very careful.\\n SCOTT LANG: No, you\\'re being very Hulky.\\n BRUCE BANNER: I\\'m being careful.\\n SCOTT LANG: [Holding up the red glass bottle] These are Pym Particles, alright? And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it. This is what we have. We\\'re not making any more.\\n RHODEY: Scott, calm down.\\n SCOTT LANG: Sorry. We\\'ve got enough for one round trip each. That\\'s it. No do-overs. Plus two test runs. [He accidentally presses a button, and shrinks, and then grows back to his normal size.] One test run.\\n [Cut to the testing chamber, where we see Steve, Nat, Tony, Scott, Bruce, Rhodey and Nebula standing at a control panel, presumably controlling the glass platform.]\\n SCOTT LANG: All right. I\\'m not ready for this.\\n CLINT BARTON: I\\'m game. I\\'ll do it.\\n [Clint walks in wearing the suit Scott was moments before, the Quantum Suit.]\\n BRUCE BANNER: Clint, now you\\'re gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift. Don\\'t worry about it.\\n [Clint taking position on the platform] \\n RHODEY: Wai-Wait a second, let me ask you something. If we can do this, you know, go back in time, why don\\'t we just find baby Thanos, you know, and... [he makes a hand gesture suggesting that they strangle baby Thanos with a rope.]\\n BRUCE BANNER: [Disgusted] First of all, that\\'s horrible...\\n RHODEY: [In a tone that says it\\'s what we\\'re all thinking.] It\\'s Thanos.\\n BRUCE BANNER: ...And secondly, time doesn\\'t work that way. Changing the past doesn\\'t change the future.\\n SCOTT LANG: Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them... Thanos doesn\\'t have the stones. Problem solved.\\n CLINT BARTON: Bingo.\\n NEBULA: That\\'s not how it works.\\n CLINT BARTON: Well, that\\'s what I heard.\\n BRUCE BANNER: What? By who? Who told you that?\\n RHODEY: [counting with his fingers] Star Trek, Terminator, TimeCop, Time After Time -\\n SCOTT LANG: Quantum Leap -\\n RHODEY: A Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time -\\n SCOTT LANG: Hot Tub Time Machine -\\n RHODEY: Hot Tub Time Machine. Bill and Ted\\'s Excellent Adventure. Basically, any movie that deals with time travel.\\n SCOTT LANG: Die Hard? No, it\\'s not one...\\n RHODEY: This is known.\\n BRUCE BANNER: I don\\'t know why everyone believes that, but that isn\\'t true. Think about it: If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future. And your former present becomes the past. Which can\\'t now be changed by your new future...\\n NEBULA: Exactly.\\n SCOTT LANG: So... Back To The Future\\'s a bunch of bullshit?\\n BRUCE BANNER: [Turning to Clint] Alright, Clint. We\\'re going in 3... 2... 1!\\n [A helmet similar to Ant-Man\\'s but white and more visible face pops on Clint\\'s head, and he goes quantum. Clint flies through the quantum realm and into an opening. He grows back to normal size, but he\\'s at a different place, and seemingly, time.]\\n [Clint look around his family home, which unlike at the start of the movie, looks a lot more alive. The helmet pops off of Clint\\'s head, and he looks around bewildered. He sees a baseball glove on the ground, presumably belonging to one of his sons, and picks it up. We hear a noise from inside the house, someone who Clint hasn\\'t seen for five years.]\\n LILA BARTON: [offscreen] Cooper? Where are my headphones?\\n CLINT BARTON: [murmuring] Lila? [The device on his hand starts beeping, signalling the end of this visit] Lila! [He dives for the door, but only manages to open it before he shrinks back to go back to the future.]\\n [We hear footsteps coming towards where Clint has just disappeared, and we see Lila coming down the stairs in Avril Lavigne-like clothing, looking around, puzzled]\\n LILA BARTON: Yeah, Dad? [She looks around] Dad?\\n [Lila goes back upstairs, deciding that it was just nothing]\\n [Cut to the Avengers Compound, we see Clint rematerialise on the glass platform, breathing heavily and sitting on the platform.]\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Hey, hey. Look at me. You okay?\\n CLINT BARTON: [Holding up the baseball glove and throw it to Stark] Yeah, it worked. It worked.\\n [Scene cuts to the Avengers in a room with some hologram displays, showcasing each of the six Infinity Stones, sitting around a table. Tony, Steve and Bruce are pacing at the front, clearly leading the planning of the mission.]\\n STEVE ROGERS: Okay, so the \"how\" works. Now we gotta figure out the when and the where. Almost all of us has had an encounter with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.\\n TONY STARK: Well I\\'d substitute the word encounter for damn well near been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones.\\n SCOTT LANG: I haven\\'t, I don\\'t even know what the hell you\\'re all talking about\\n BRUCE BANNER: Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round trip each, and these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.\\n TONY STARK: Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in.\\n CLINT BARTON: Which means we have to pick our targets.\\n TONY STARK: Correct.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Let\\'s start with the Aether. Thor, what do you know?\\n [We see Thor sitting on a chair with his sunglasses on. It is impossible to tell whether he is awake or asleep.]\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Is he asleep?\\n RHODEY: No, I\\'m pretty sure he\\'s dead.\\n [Thor wakes up]\\n THOR: Where to start? Umm... The Aether, first, is not a stone, someone called it a stone before. It\\'s more of a... an angry sludge thing, so... someones gonna need to amend that. Here\\'s an interesting story though, many years ago... My grandfather had to hide the stones from the Dark Elves... [He wiggles his fingers to imitate a spooky ghost] Wooooh, scary beings. So Jane, [An image of Jane Foster pops up on the screen] Oh, there she is. That\\'s Jane... She\\'s... an old flame of mine... She... she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time... and then the Aether stuck itself inside her... And, she became very, very sick. So I had to take her to Asgard, which is where I\\'m from. And we had to try and fix her. We were dating at the time, you see. I got to introduce her to my Mother... who\\'s dead, [Thor starts to look broken, and seems on the verge of tears] and oh you know, Jane and I aren\\'t even dating anymore, these things happen though you know, nothing last forever, [Tony starts to push him back to his chair] I\\'m not done yet, the only thing permanent in life is impermanence.\\n TONY STARK: Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?\\n THOR: I\\'d like a Bloody Mary, thank you.\\n [Cut to the Avengers sitting around a table, eating a meal, and Rocket is pacing on the table in front of everyone.]\\n ROCKET: Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.\\n SCOTT LANG: Is that a person?\\n ROCKET: Morag\\'s a planet. Quill was a person.\\n SCOTT LANG: A planet? Like in outer space?\\n ROCKET: Oh, look. It\\'s like a little puppy, all happy and everything. [Imitating talking to a puppy] Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy? I\\'ll get you to space.\\n [Cut to everyone facing Nebula in the planning room, and Nat writing notes for their plan.]\\n NEBULA: Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: [In a business-like tone] What is Vormir?\\n NEBULA: A dominion of death, at the very center of Celestial existence. It\\'s where... Thanos murdered my sister.\\n [Nat looks up, and an awkward silence falls upon the room. She writes what Nebula has just said, and Scott makes to break the awkward moment.]\\n SCOTT LANG: Not it.\\n [We see Tony and Nat lying on a table surrounded by papers, and Bruce lying down on the floor. The Time Stone pops up on the display.]\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: That Time Stone guy...\\n BRUCE BANNER: Doctor Strange.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?\\n TONY STARK: Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit from a hat.\\n BRUCE BANNER: Nice place in the village, though.\\n TONY STARK: Yeah. Sullivan Street.\\n BRUCE BANNER: Hmm... Bleecker.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Wait, he lived in New York?\\n TONY STARK: No. He lived in Toronto. Were you even paying attention?\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Guys, if you pick the right year, there are three stones in New York.\\n BRUCE BANNER: [Sitting up in surprise] Shut the front door.\\n [Shot cuts to the holograms displaying the different location, the Soul and Power Stones in space in 2014. the Reality Stone in Asgard, 2013; and the Space, Mind, and Time Stones in New York City, 2012]\\n STEVE ROGERS: All right. We have a plan. Six Stones, three teams. One shot.\\n [He and the other Avengers walk up and look at the screens determinedly.]\\n [The shot cuts to the Avengers walking in a file to the Quantum Time machine, wearing the Quantum Suits, albeit with some minor differences for different people. Rhodey has a bulkier repaint of the War machine armour. ]\\n STEVE ROGERS: Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends... We lost family... We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know. But it doesn\\'t mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we\\'re gonna win. [Tony gives Steve a look] Whatever it takes. Good luck.\\n ROCKET:[Refers to Steve\\'s speaking] He\\'s pretty good at that.\\n SCOTT LANG: Right? [Looks very excited]\\n TONY STARK: All right. You heard the man. Stroke those keys, jolly green.\\n BRUCE BANNER: Tractors engaged.\\n ROCKET: [Addressing the shrunk Benatar in Clint\\'s hand] You promise to bring that back in one piece, right?\\n CLINT BARTON: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I\\'ll do my best.\\n ROCKET: As promises go, that was pretty lame.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: [Smiling excitedly] See you in a minute.\\n [They all shrink and enter the Quantum Realm, and they all split at different intervals, going to a different place at a different time in history.]\\n [The First Group which has Tony, Steve, Bruce, & Scott; travels to New York in 2012. A previous stock shot of the Chitauri snarling and the iconic circle take around our six Original Avengers assembling before panning over to a side street where Scott, Steve, Banner and Tony materialise.]\\n STEVE ROGERS: All right, we all have our assignments. Two Stones uptown, one Stone, down. Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock.\\n [2012 Hulk passes by them, smashing everything in his way. Bruce puts his hand on his face, embarrassed.]\\n STEVE ROGERS: Feel free to smash a few things along the way.\\n BRUCE BANNER: I think it\\'s gratuitous, but whatever.\\n [Present Bruce pretends to smash things in a sarcastic way. He tears his shirt off, and walks over to a car. He lightly punches the car, making a small dent, all the while making growling noises. He picks up a motorbike and throws it at a wall, wincing as it hits the wall.]\\n [Shot cuts to the Roof of the Sanctum Sanctorum where 2012 The Ancient One protects it. Bruce tries to enter through the roof before noticing her.]\\n THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I\\'d be careful going that way. We just had the floors waxed.\\n BRUCE BANNER: I\\'m looking for Doctor Strange.\\n THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): You\\'re about... five years too early. Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery about twenty blocks that way. What do you want from him?\\n BRUCE BANNER: That, actually.\\n [He points towards the Eye of Agamotto where the Time Stone is kept. The Ancient One (2012) looks at it]\\n THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): Ah! I\\'m afraid not.\\n BRUCE BANNER: Sorry, but I wasn\\'t asking.\\n THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): You don\\'t wanna do this.\\n BRUCE BANNER: Ah, you\\'re right, I don\\'t. [He makes a grab at the Eye of Agamotto] But I need that stone, and I don\\'t have time to beat it-\\n [The Ancient One (2012) pushes Bruce\\' astral form out of his body. Bruce who\\'s is now in astral form looks at The Ancient One horrified.]\\n THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): Let\\'s start over, shall we?\\n [Cut to an aerial shot of Asgard in 2013.Then to the prison in Asgard, where we see the Loki from The Dark World, sitting in his cell. Without him noticing, Rocket and Thor creep by, past the cell. They stop at a pillar a few metres away room of where Jane Foster is]\\n THOR: That\\'s Jane.\\n ROCKET: All right. Here\\'s the deal, Tubby: You\\'re gonna charm her and I\\'m gonna poke her with this thing, [He holds up a device.] and extract the Reality Stone and get gone, lickety-split.\\n THOR: I\\'ll be right back, okay? There\\'s a wine cellar, that\\'s just down there. My father used to fish huge barrel of ale. I\\'ll see if the cellar has a couple of...\\n ROCKET: Hey! Hey! Aren\\'t you drunk enough already?\\n [A door opens, Thor and Rocket both try to hide. We then see ladies along with Frigga (2013) walking. Thor sees his mother.]\\n ROCKET: Who\\'s the fancy broad?\\n THOR: It\\'s my Mother. She dies today.\\n ROCKET: Oh. That\\'s today?\\n THOR: I can\\'t do this. I can\\'t do this. I shouldn\\'t be here. I shouldn\\'t have come.This was a bad idea.\\n ROCKET: Come here. [Standing in front of him]\\n THOR: No, no, no. I think I\\'m having...I\\'m having a panic attack. I shouldn\\'t be here...this is...this is a bad-\\n ROCKET: Come here. Right here.\\n [Rocket slaps Thor in the face.]\\n ROCKET: You think you\\'re the only one who lost people? What do you think we\\'re doing here? I lost the only family I ever had. Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna, all gone. Now, I get you miss your Mom. But she\\'s gone. Really gone. And there are plenty of people who are only kinda gone. But you can help them. So is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs outta your beard, make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants, and when she\\'s not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone and help me get my family back?\\n THOR: Okay.\\n ROCKET: Are you crying?\\n THOR: No...Yes!\\n ROCKET: Get it together! You can do this. You can do this. All right?\\n THOR: Yes, I can.\\n ROCKET: Good.\\n THOR: I can do this. I can do it, I can\\'t do this.\\n [Thor runs away.]\\n ROCKET: Alright, Heartbreaker. She\\'s alone. This is our shot. [He turns back to where Thor was moments ago] Thor? Thor! Aaagh!!!\\n [Cut to Morag in 2014, where we see Rhodey getting off the Benatar as it lands.]\\n RHODEY: Alright. Bring it down low. Right on that line. That\\'s it. Down, down.\\n CLINT BARTON: Hey, can we hurry it up?\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Guys, chop-chop. Come on. We\\'re on a clock.\\n [Nebula walks out of the ship, apparently having directed it to its next destination.\\n RHODEY: All that, is really helpful. [Hugging Natasha] Take care, okay?\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Yeah.\\n RHODEY: Take that stone and come back. No messing around.\\n CLINT BARTON: [To Rhodey] Hey. You got this.\\n RHODEY: Let\\'s get it done. Yes, sir.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: [Walking with Clint back into the ship] See you back.\\n RHODEY: You guys watch each other\\'s six.\\n [Clint and Nat look back and just smile.]\\n CLINT BARTON: Yeah.\\n [They walk back into the ship, and the hatch closes. The ship takes off and speeds out of the atmosphere of Morag.]\\n NEBULA: The coordinates for Vormir are laid in. All they have to do is not fall out.\\n [In the Benatar, Clint and Nat are sitting at the front of the ship. The ship takes a jump through space and speeds up tremendously. Nat and Clint look at each other.]\\n CLINT BARTON: It\\'s a long way from Budapest.\\n [Natasha just laughs.]\\n [Back to Morag, where Rhodey and Nebula are standing where we left them.]\\n RHODEY: Okay, so, uhh... We just wait around for this Quill guy to show up and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?\\n NEBULA: [Looking around] Let\\'s take cover. We\\'re not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.\\n RHODEY: Wait a minute, what are you talking about right now? Who else is looking for these stones?\\n NEBULA: My father, my sister... and me.\\n RHODEY: And you? Where are you right now?\\n [Cuts to a scene of Gamora (2014) and Nebula (2014) fighting some Korbinite soldiers.]\\n GAMORA (2014): [Helping Nebula up] You\\'re welcome.\\n NEBULA (2014): I didn\\'t ask for your help.\\n GAMORA (2014): And yet, you always need it. [Nebula (2014) laughs and Gamora\\'s hand.] Get up. Father wants us back on the ship.\\n NEBULA (2014): Why?\\n GAMORA (2014): He\\'s found an Infinity Stone.\\n NEBULA (2014): Where?\\n GAMORA (2014): On a planet called Morag.\\n NEBULA (2014): Father\\'s plan is finally in motion.\\n GAMORA (2014): One stone isn\\'t six, Nebula.\\n NEBULA (2014): It’s a start.\\n GAMORA (2014): If he gets all of them...\\n [Thanos (2014) arrives, honking badass double-bladed sword in tow and healthy coating blood of his armour.]\\n THANOS (2014): Ronan\\'s located the Power Stone. I\\'m dispatching you to his ship.\\n GAMORA (2014): He won\\'t like that.\\n THANOS (2014): His alternative is death, then. [Thanos wipes his double-bladed sword] Ronan\\'s obsession clouds his judgement.\\n NEBULA (2014): We will not fail you, Father.\\n [Gamora (2014) rolls her eyes]\\n THANOS (2014): No, you won\\'t.\\n NEBULA (2014): I swear...I will make you proud.\\n [Nebula (2014) is suddenly in pain and opens up future Nebula\\'s memories.]\\n RHODEY (Memory): We just, wait around for this Quill guy to show up, and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?\\n NEBULA (Memory): Let\\'s take cover. We\\'re not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.\\n [Nebula (2014) shuts off the memory]\\n GAMORA (2014): Who was that?\\n NEBULA (2014): I don\\'t know...My head is splitting...I don\\'t know...\\n GAMORA (2014): Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle.\\n [Thanos walks towards Nebula and brings his blade to her throat.]\\n THANOS (2014): Shhh... (pointing to Nebula) Bring her to my ship.\\n [Cut to present Tony Stark flying around Stark Tower in the Mark 85. He scans the interior of the tower, and sees the original Avengers apprehending Loki, the backside of the iconic shot of Hawkeye pointing the bow at Loki\\'s face while the Avengers surround him.]\\n TONY STARK: Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like they\\'re just about wrapped up here.\\n [Cut to Steve in Stark Tower, walking towards the elevator.]\\n STEVE ROGERS: Got it. I\\'m approaching the elevator now.\\n LOKI (2012): If it\\'s all the same to you... I\\'ll have that drink now.\\n TONY STARK (2012): All right, get him on his feet. We can all stand around posing up a storm later. By the way, feel free to clean up.\\n TONY STARK: Uh, Mr. Rogers. I almost forgot that that suit [A shot of Cap walking around in his 2012 suit] did nothing for your ass.\\n STEVE ROGERS: No one asked you to look, Tony.\\n TONY STARK: [whispers] It\\'s ridiculous\\n SCOTT LANG: I think you look great, Cap. As far as I\\'m concerned, that\\'s America\\'s ass. [Does a patriotic salute.]\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF (2012): Who gets the, uh, magic wand?\\n TONY STARK (2012): STRIKE team\\'s coming to secure it.\\n [A Hydra team including Rumlow and Sitwell enter, known at this time as a part of SHIELD.]\\n SITWELL (2012): We can take that [Taking Loki\\'s Scepter from 2012 Natasha] off your hands.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF (2012): By all means. Careful with that thing.\\n CLINT BARTON (2012): Unless you want your mind erased. And not in a fun way.\\n SITWELL (2012): We promise to be careful.\\n SCOTT LANG: Who are these guys?\\n TONY STARK: They are SHIELD...Well, actually Hydra. But, we didn\\'t know that yet.\\n SCOTT LANG: Seriously, you didn\\'t? I mean...they look like bad guys.\\n TONY STARK: You\\'re small, but you\\'re talking loud.\\n STEVE ROGERS (2012): On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.\\n LOKI (2012): [Transforming into Steve for a second in imitation] On my way down to coordinate search and rescue! [Transforming back] I mean, honestly! How do you think you\\'ll be...\\n THOR (2012): [Slapping on a device on Loki\\'s mouth to make him quiet] Shut up.\\n TONY STARK: All right, you\\'re up, little buddy. [Looking at the briefcase with the Tesseract] There\\'s our stone.\\n SCOTT LANG: [Lying down on Tony\\'s shoulder] Alright.

Maximum occupancy has been reached.\\n THOR (2012): Take the stairs.\\n TONY STARK (2012): Yeah. [Hulk draws his fist back right as the elevator door closes] Stop. Stop!\\n [He follows through with the punch, making a dent in the wall right where the door was.]\\n HULK (2012): [Pissed] Take the stairs! Hate the stairs!\\n TONY STARK: All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the elevator just passing the 80th floor.\\n STEVE ROGERS: On it. Head to the lobby.\\n TONY STARK: Alright. I\\'ll see you there.\\n [scene cuts to HYDRA agents in the elevator]\\n SITWELL (2012): Evidence secure. We\\'re en route to Dr. List. No. No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary.\\n [Elevator opens and HYDRA agents sees Steve. Steve walks in and hits the button to continue down.]\\n SITWELL (2012): Captain. I thought you were coordinating search and rescue?\\n STEVE ROGERS: Change of plans.\\n RUMLOW (2012): Hey, Cap.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Rumlow. [everyone starts getting suspicious and has their guard up] I just got a call from the Secretary. I\\'m gonna be running point on the scepter.\\n SITWELL (2012): Sir? I don\\'t understand.\\n STEVE ROGERS: We got word there may be an attempt to steal it.\\n RUMLOW (2012): Sorry, Cap. I can\\'t give you the scepter.\\n SITWELL (2012): I\\'m gonna have to call the Director.\\n STEVE ROGERS: That\\'s okay. Trust me.

Now.\\n ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): May I ask you where you\\'re going?\\n THOR (2012): To lunch and then Asgard. I\\'m sorry, you are?\\n TONY STARK (2012): Alexander Pierce. He\\'s the man, one of the folks behind Nick Fury.\\n ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): My friends call me Mr. Secretary. I\\'m gonna have to ask you to turn that prisoner over to me.\\n THOR (2012): Loki will be answering to Odin himself.\\n ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Oh, he\\'s gonna answer to us. Odin can have what\\'s left. And I\\'m gonna need that case, that\\'s been SHIELD property for over 70 years.\\n HYDRA AGENT: Hand over the case, Stark.\\n TONY STARK: [To present Scott through radio as he inhales sharply] All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey up here. Let\\'s go.\\n TONY STARK(2012): I\\'m not gonna argue who\\'s got the higher authority here, all right?\\n SCOTT LANG: You promise me you won\\'t die?\\n TONY STARK: You\\'re only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.\\n SCOTT LANG: That doesn\\'t sound mild.\\n ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): I need the case.\\n TONY STARK (2012): I know you got a lotta pull. I\\'m just saying...\\n ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Okay. Then give me the case.\\n TONY STARK: Do it, Lang!\\n TONY STARK (2012): Get your hands off!\\n TONY STARK: Window\\'s closing. Pull my pin!\\n SCOTT LANG: Here goes!\\n [Ant-Man pulls off Stark 2012\\'s reactor, and Tony (2012) drops the case]\\n ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Stark?\\n THOR (2012): Stark!\\n [Stark 2012 falls down to the ground]\\n ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Look, he\\'s convulsing. Give him air! Medic!\\n TONY STARK: MEDIC! You guys, some help!\\n ALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Stark, you--- your chest machine?\\n [Ant-Man pushes the case, Loki looks at case, Tony Stark grabs the case.]\\n TONY STARK: Good job. Meet me in the alley. I\\'m gonna grab a quick slice.\\n [Suddenly, Hulk 2012 pushes Tony to the ground and the Tesseract slides to Loki]\\n HULK (2012): NO STAIRS!!!!\\n [Everyone runs from Hulk\\'s rampage, Loki 2012 grabs the Tesseract and teleports it away.]\\n THOR (2012): You\\'ll be fine, Stark. Stay with us! I\\'ll try something, okay? I have no idea if it\\'s gonna work.\\n [Thor 2012 uses the Mjolnir as the defibrillator on Tony Stark 2012]\\n THOR (2012): YES!\\n TONY STARK (2012): That worked a treat. That was so crazy!\\n THOR (2012): I had no idea if that was gonna work.\\n TONY STARK (2012): The case?\\n THOR (2012): The case. It\\'s, uhh... Where\\'s the case? Where\\'s Loki? Loki!\\n SCOTT LANG: That wasn\\'t supposed to happen, was it?\\n TONY STARK: Oh, we blew it.\\n THOR (2012): Loki!?\\n [Cut to a walkway several floors up. Steve is having trouble on his communicator.]\\n STEVE ROGERS: Tony, what\\'s going on? Tell me you found that cube. [He looks up and groans.] Oh, you gotta be shitting me.\\n [In front of him, Steve sees his 2012 self looking back]\\n STEVE ROGERS (2012): I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.\\n STEVE ROGERS: [Puts the case down] I\\'m not Loki. And I don\\'t wanna hurt you.\\n [2012 Steve engages and the two Captain Americas begin to duel.]\\n STEVE ROGERS (2012): I can do this all day.\\n STEVE ROGERS: [Standing up] Yeah, I know. I know.\\n [Both Rogers\\' frisbee their shield\\'s at one another which clang away as they brawl, inadvertently kicking away the case containing the scepter which falls down a few levels. 2012 Steve gets the upper hand on Future Steve\\'s as they both fall down to the same level as the scepter. Future Steve\\'s locket of Peggy falls out, Steve (2012) notices it.]\\n STEVE ROGERS (2012): Where did you get this?\\n [Steve (2012) has future Steve in a chokehold]\\n STEVE ROGERS: Bucky... is... alive!\\n STEVE ROGERS (2012): What?\\n [Future Steve takes the chance to sucker punch his counterpart, grab the scepter and knock Steve (2012) out, gets up and stares at him]\\n STEVE ROGERS: That is America\\'s ass.\\n [Scene cuts back to Bruce and The Ancient One (2012). As Hulk is lying down on a beach chair who looks like he\\'s sleeping with a hat on, Bruce Banner tries reasoning with the Ancient One to let him have the Time Stone.]\\n BRUCE BANNER: Please, please!\\n THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t help you, Bruce. If I give up the Time Stone to help your Reality, I\\'m dooming my own.\\n BRUCE BANNER: With all due respect, I\\'m not sure the science really supports that.\\n [The Ancient One creates a projection with a long ray that simulates the flow of time.]\\n THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): The Infinity Stones create what you experience as the flow of time. Remove one stone and that flow splits. [She flicks the Time Stone projection away and Shows black stream indicating a point of divergence] Now, this may benefit your reality, but my new one…not so much. In this new branched Reality, without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness, our world will be overrun. Millions will suffer. So, tell me, Doctor, can your science prevent all that?\\n BRUCE BANNER: No, but we can erase it. Because once we are done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline at the moment it was taken. So, chronologically, [Holds the Time Stone projection] in that reality, [puts it back to its spot] it never left.\\n [Bruce\\'s astral form takes the projection of the removed Time Stone, replaces it back amongst the other five, and the doomed alternate dimension fades away, illustrating his point.]\\n THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): [still not convinced.] But you are leaving out the most important part. In order to return the stones, you have to survive.\\n BRUCE BANNER: We will. I will. I promise.\\n THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I can\\'t risk this Reality on a promise. It is the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone.\\n BRUCE BANNER: Then, why the hell did Strange give it away?\\n THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): [Surprised] What did you say?\\n BRUCE BANNER: Strange, he gave it away. He gave it to Thanos.\\n THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): Willingly?\\n BRUCE BANNER: Yes!\\n THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): ...Why?\\n BRUCE BANNER: I have no idea. Maybe he made a mistake.\\n THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): Or I did. [She returns to Banner control of his Hulk body and opens the Eye of Agamotto, revealing the Time Stone] Strange is meant to be the best of us.\\n BRUCE BANNER: So he must have done it for a reason.\\n THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I fear you might be right. [gives him the Time Stone]\\n BRUCE BANNER: Thank you.\\n THE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I\\'m counting on you, Bruce. We all are.\\n [Cut to Thanos (2014), Nebula (2014), Gamora (2014) and Ebony Maw (2014) on the Sanctuary II.]\\n THANOS (2014): [To Ebony Maw] Run diagnostics. Show me her memory file.\\n EBONY MAW (2014): Sire, the file appears entangled. It was a memory, but not hers. There\\'s another consciousness sharing her network...another Nebula.\\n THANOS (2014): Impossible.\\n EBONY MAW (2014): This duplicate carries a time stamp... from nine years in the future.\\n THANOS (2014): Where is this other Nebula?\\n EBONY MAW (2014): In our solar system. On Morag.\\n THANOS (2014): Can you access her?\\n EBONY MAW (2014): Yes. The two are linked.\\n THANOS (2014): Search the duplicate\\'s memories for Infinity Stones.\\n [Memory of the meeting with all the Avengers starts playing]\\n BRUCE BANNER (2023): And these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.\\n TONY STARK (2023): Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in.\\n CLINT BARTON (2023): Which means we have to pick our targets.\\n TONY STARK (2023): Correct.\\n [End memory.]\\n THANOS (2014): [To Ebony Maw] Freeze image.\\n GAMORA (2014): Terrans.\\n THANOS (2014): Avengers. Unruly wretches. What\\'s that reflection? Amplify this, Maw.\\n GAMORA (2014): [Looking at a reflection of Nebula (2023)] I don\\'t understand. Two Nebulas.\\n THANOS (2014): No. The same Nebula. From two different times. Set course for Morag. Scan the duplicate\\'s memories. I want to see everything.\\n [Cut back to Thor and Rocket in Asgard, 2013]\\n FRIGGA (2013): My ladies, I\\'ll see you after. Go on.\\n [Thor tries not to get caught behind a large post, but gets shocked when he sees his mother behind him] \\n FRIGGA (2013): [To Thor] What are you doing?\\n THOR: Aah!!!\\n FRIGGA (2013): Aah!!!\\n THOR: OH, God!\\n FRIGGA (2013): You\\'re better off leaving the sneaking to your brother.\\n THOR: Yeah, I was simply just going for a walk, and uh...

This is one of my favorites.\\n [Frigga puts her hand on Thor\\'s face and takes a good look at him}\\n FRIGGA (2013): What\\'s wrong with your eye?\\n THOR: Oh, my eye. That\\'s... you remember the Battle of Haroquin? When I got hit in the face with a broadsword?\\n FRIGGA (2013): You\\'re not the Thor I know at all, are you?\\n THOR: [Pretending] Yes, I am.\\n FRIGGA (2013): The future hasn\\'t been kind to you, has it?\\n THOR: I didn\\'t say I\\'m from the future.\\n FRIGGA (2013): I was raised by witches, boy. I see with more than eyes, and you know that.\\n [Thor attempts to hold back his tears and fails miserably.]\\n THOR: [voice breaking up] I am totally, totally from the future.\\n FRIGGA (2013): Yes, you are.\\n THOR: I really need to talk to you.\\n FRIGGA (2013): We can talk.\\n [They both hug each other.]\\n [Scene cuts to Jane Foster waking up while Rocket sneaks behind her to extract the Aether] \\n [Scene cuts back to Thor and Frigga\\'s conversation.]\\n THOR: His head was over there... His body over there... What was the point? I was too late. I was just standing there. Some idiot with an axe.\\n FRIGGA (2013): You\\'re no idiot. You\\'re here aren\\'t you? Seeking counsel from the wisest person in Asgard.\\n THOR: I guess, yeah.\\n FRIGGA (2013): Idiot? No. A failure? Absolutely.\\n THOR: That\\'s a little bit harsh.\\n FRIGGA (2013): You do know what that makes you? Just like everyone else.\\n THOR: I\\'m not supposed to be like everyone else, am I?\\n FRIGGA (2013): Everyone fails at who they are supposed to be, Thor. The measure of a person, of a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are.\\n THOR: I really missed you, Mum.\\n [scene cuts to Rocket running away from the Asgardian soldiers]\\n ROCKET: Thor! I got it!\\n ASGARDIAN SOLDIER (2013): Get that rabbit!\\n THOR: Ma, I have to tell you something.\\n FRIGGA (2013): No, son. You don\\'t. You\\'re here to repair your future, not mine.\\n THOR: But this is about your future.\\n FRIGGA (2013): It\\'s none of my business. [does she know?]\\n ROCKET: Hey. You must be Mom. I got the thing. Come on, we got to move.\\n THOR: I wish we had more time.\\n FRIGGA (2013): No, this was a gift. And you\\'re going to be the man you\\'re meant to be.\\n THOR: I love you, Mom.\\n FRIGGA (2013): I love you. And eat a salad.\\n ROCKET: Come on. We gotta go.\\n FRIGGA (2013): [whispers] Goodbye.\\n ROCKET: Three... two...\\n THOR: No, wait!\\n [Thor holds out his hand]\\n ROCKET: [To Frigga] Wh- what am I looking at?\\n FRIGGA (2013): Oh, sometimes it takes a second.\\n [Thor summons Mjolnir.]\\n THOR: [Happy and a little bit surprised] I\\'m still worthy.\\n [\"Come And Get Your Love\" starts playing in the background.]\\n ROCKET: Oh, boy.\\n THOR: Goodbye, Mom.\\n FRIGGA (2013): [whispers] Goodbye.\\n [Scene cuts to Quill on Morag dancing to \"Come And Get Your Love\", we then pan over to Rhodey and Nebula hiding in the background watching Quill dance and sing to their perspective without music.]\\n RHODEY: So he\\'s an idiot?\\n NEBULA: Yeah.\\n [Rhodey knocks out Quill and Nebula rummages around to take Quill\\'s tool.]\\n RHODEY: What\\'s that?\\n NEBULA: The tool of a thief.\\n [Nebula uses the tool to open the door that leads to The Orb A.K.A The Power Stone.

All right. Go ahead.\\n [Nebula forces her hand inside the force field protecting The Orb while it melts away the exterior plating on her arm.

Reduced to atoms.\\n BRUCE (Memory): You used them two days ago.\\n THANOS (Memory): I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be. I am inevitable.\\n [Memory pauses.]\\n GAMORA (2014): What did you do to them?\\n THANOS (2014): Nothing. Yet. They\\'re not trying to stop something I\\'m going to do in our time. They\\'re trying to undo something I\\'ve already done in theirs.\\n GAMORA (2014): The stones...\\n THANOS (2014): I found them all. I won.

It\\'s not. I could never...\\nI would never betray you. Never.\\n [Thanos (2014) releases the chain around Nebula (2014) neck and holds her head in his palm]\\n THANOS (2014): I know. And you\\'ll have the chance to prove it.\\n [Thanos (2014) makes sure Nebula cannot travel back to 2023. Nebula is stuck in 2014.]\\n NEBULA: No! He knows!

You wanna know what\\nhe does to you?\\n NEBULA (2014): That\\'s enough. [kicks Present Nebula to the wall and pulls out her Electric Knife.] You disgust me. But that doesn\\'t\\nmean you\\'re useless.\\n [Nebula (2014) steals the golden plate on the side of Present Nebula´s face and wears it herself.]\\n [Then she walks up to Thanos, gives him a Pym Particle and shows him her new look.]\\n NEBULA (2014): How do I look?\\n [Scene cuts to Vormir 2014 where Natasha and Clint arrives].\\n CLINT BARTON: Wow– Under different circumstances, this would be totally awesome.\\n [Natasha and Clint starts walking towards the mountain and climb it.]\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: \\nI bet the raccoon didn\\'t\\nhave to climb a mountain.\\n CLINT BARTON: \\nTechnically, he\\'s not\\na raccoon, you know.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: \\nWhatever.

For the other... In order to take the stone, you\\nmust lose that which you love. An everlasting exchange. A soul, for a soul.\\n [scene cuts to Natasha sitting on a log while Clint watches the Stonekeeper.]\\n CLINT BARTON: How\\'s it going? Jesus...Maybe he\\'s making this shit up.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: No. I don\\'t think so.\\n CLINT BARTON: Why, \\'cause he knows your Daddy\\'s name?\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: I didn\\'t. Thanos left here with the stone without his daughter. It\\'s not a coincidence.\\n CLINT BARTON: Yeah.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: Whatever it takes.\\n CLINT BARTON: Whatever it takes.\\n [Natasha stands up.]\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: If we don\\'t get that stone, billions of people stay dead.\\n CLINT BARTON: Then I guess we both know who it\\'s gotta be.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: \\nI guess we do.\\n [Clint holds Natasha\\'s hand and she reciprocates and they look at each other]\\n CLINT BARTON: \\nI\\'m starting to think– we mean different people here, Natasha.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: For the last five years I\\'ve been trying to do one thing: Get to right here.

You win.\\n [Clint smiles and knocks Natasha to the ground]\\n CLINT BARTON: \\nTell my family I love them.\\n [Natasha returns the favor by tackling Clint to the ground]\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF:  \\nYou tell them yourself.\\n [Natasha electrocutes Clint and she runs towards the cliff. Clint gets up and shoots an explosive arrow knocking her down. Clint then runs towards the cliff and jumps. Natasha jumps after him and hooks him up to a grappling hook]\\n CLINT BARTON: \\nDamn you!\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: \\nLet me go.\\n CLINT BARTON: \\nNo. Please, no.\\n NATASHA ROMANOFF: \\nIt\\'s okay.\\n CLINT BARTON: \\nPlease– [Natasha kicks the wall, falls off the rope, and plummets to the ground.] NO!!!\\n [The shot shows her body on the ground, dead. A boom in the sky sends Clint in a pool of water with the Soul Stone in his hand. He hits the ground out of sadness. His Quantum Suit activates and he shrinks back to the present day, soon joined by the others returning from their journeys.]\\n [Cut to the Avengers HQ and the Quantum platform everyone looks around to see all the recovered stones]\\n BRUCE BANNER: \\nDid we get them all?\\n RHODEY: You telling me this\\'ll\\nactually work?\\n [There\\'s a pause as everyone starts to realise someone is missing]\\n BRUCE BANNER: \\nClint, where\\'s Nat?\\n [The silence from Clint tells them all they need to know.

Lakeside, Tony, Steve, Thor, Clint, and Bruce are mourning their fallen teammate and friend]\\n TONY STARK: Do we know if she had family?\\n STEVE ROGERS: Yeah. Us.\\n THOR: (confused) What?\\n TONY STARK: I just asked him a question–\\n THOR: Yeah, you\\'re acting like she\\'s dead. Why are we acting like she\\'s dead? We have the stones, right? As long as we have the stones, Cap, we can bring her back, isn\\'t that right? [GROWLING.] So stop this shit. We\\'re the Avengers, get it together.\\n CLINT BARTON: We can\\'t get her back.\\n THOR: Wha– what?\\n CLINT BARTON: It can\\'t be undone. It can\\'t.\\n [Thor dryly laughs.]\\n THOR: I\\'m sorry. No offense, but you\\'re\\na very earthly being. Okay? We\\'re talking about space magic. And \"can\\'t\" seems very definitive don\\'t you think?\\n CLINT BARTON: (to Thor) Yeah, look, I know that I\\'m way outside my paygrade here. But she still isn\\'t here, is she?\\n THOR: No, that\\'s my point–\\n CLINT BARTON: It can\\'t– be undone. Or that\\'s at least what the red floating guy had to say. (shouts) Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay? GO GRAB YOUR HAMMER, AND YOU GO FLY AND TALK TO HIM!\\n [Clint\\'s anger is quickly replaced with grief]\\n CLINT BARTON: It was supposed to be me. She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone. She bet her life on it.\\n [In a burst of anger, Bruce grabs a bench and hurls it clear across the lake. His anger spent, he turns to the others with a resigned look on his face]\\n BRUCE BANNER: She\\'s not coming back. We have to make it worth it. We have to.\\n STEVE ROGERS: We will.\\n [Cut to inside the Avenger\\'s Lab. Tony carefully places the stones in the gauntlet he made while Bruce and Rocket watches. With nervous precision, Tony manipulates the machine and carefully places all six stones into the gauntlet]\\n ROCKET: Boom!\\n [Tony and Bruce jump a bit, and quickly groan at Rocket\\'s joke. Scene cuts to another room with the new finished gauntlet. Everyone is gathered around it.]\\n ROCKET: All right. The glove\\'s ready. Question is, who\\'s gonna snap their freaking fingers?\\n THOR: I\\'ll do it.\\n SCOTT LANG: Excuse me?\\n THOR: It\\'s okay.\\n EVERYONE: (holding up Thor) No, no, no, whoa. Stop. Stop. Wait a sec. Hey, hey–\\n STEVE ROGERS: Wait, wait, Thor, just wait. We haven\\'t decided who\\'s gonna put that on yet.\\n THOR:\\nI\\'m sorry. What, we\\'re just sitting around waiting for the right opportunity?\\n SCOTT LANG: We should at least discuss it.\\n THOR: No, no, sitting here staring at that thing is not gonna bring everybody back. I\\'m the strongest Avenger, okay? So this responsibility falls upon me. It\\'s my duty.\\n TONY STARK: It\\'s not about that–\\n THOR: (hushes everyone up) It\\'s not that– Stop it! Just let me! (he tears up) Just let me do it. Just let me do something good. Something right.\\n TONY STARK\\xa0: Look– It\\'s not just the fact that that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent, I\\'m telling you, you\\'re in no condition.\\n THOR: What do you– What do you think is coursing through my veins right now?\\n RHODEY: Cheez Whiz?\\n THOR: Lightning.\\n TONY STARK: Yeah.\\n BRUCE: Lightning won\\'t help you, pal. It\\'s gotta be me.\\n [Thor lets go of Tony. Sorry, Thor. Maybe next time.]\\n BRUCE BANNER: You saw what those stones did to Thanos. It almost killed him. None of you could survive.\\n STEVE ROGERS: How do we know you will?\\n BRUCE BANNER: We don\\'t. But the radiation\\'s mostly gamma.

Don\\'t change anything from the last five years.\\n BRUCE BANNER: Got it.\\n [Everyone gets ready and suits up]\\n TONY STARK: F.R.I.D.A.Y., do me a favor and activate Barn Door Protocol. Will you?\\n F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Yes, boss.\\n [Avengers facility goes on lockdown]\\n BRUCE BANNER: Everybody comes home.\\n [Bruce puts on the gauntlet, which nanobotically expands to fit his hand, and the power surge overwhelms him. He grunts in pain.]\\n THOR: Take it off! Take it off!\\n STEVE ROGERS: No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?\\n TONY STARK: Talk to me, Banner.\\n BRUCE BANNER: I\\'m okay. I\\'m okay.\\n [Thor gives a double thumbs up, scene cuts to Nebula (2014) opening the Quantum Tunnel and brings the Sanctuary II to the present.]\\n [Bruce screams, fighting through the intense pain coursing through his body courtesy of the gauntlet, and manages to snap his fingers. He faints and the gauntlet slides off his arm, Clint kicks it away]\\n STEVE ROGERS: Bruce!\\n TONY STARK: Don\\'t move him.\\n BRUCE ROGERS: [Bruce holds onto Steve\\'s arm] Did it work?\\n THOR: Worth a shot. It\\'s over. It\\'s okay.\\n [Scott walks towards the outside windows and sees plants and birds. Clint hears his phone ringing and sees it\\'s his wife calling]\\n CLINT BARTON: (struggling to speak from sheer happiness) Honey. Honey.\\n SCOTT LANG: Guys– I think it worked!\\n [Bruce opens his eyes and sees the Sanctuary II up in the sky and a single missile heading towards the base blowing away Scott away. Then a continuous array of missiles destroys the base completely and everyone sinks below to the underground.]\\n [The camera pans over to see Bruce holding up tons of debris from collapsing on top of the other Avengers with his one good arm. Some debris is stuck on top of Rocket.]\\n ROCKET: I can\\'t breathe. I can\\'t breathe! I can\\'t breathe.\\n RHODEY: Canopy. Canopy. Canopy. [Rhodey gets out of his damaged suit]\\n BRUCE BANNER: Rhodey, Rocket, get outta here!\\n [Rhodey crawls over to help Rocket while taking a rebar as leverage to lift the debris off Rocket]\\n ROCKET: Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on!\\n [Rhodey gets Rocket out and they both sigh in relief]\\n BRUCE BANNER: Rhodey!\\n [A flood engulfs both Rhodey and Rocket]\\n [Scene cuts to Scott who survives the blast by shrinking.]\\n RHODEY: Mayday, mayday!

I\\'m here, can you hear me?\\n [Scene cuts to Clint in the sewer system and trying to get his bearings. He flashes a light upwards to see what happened.]\\n CLINT BARTON: Cap?\\n [Clint finds the gauntlet is with him but senses he\\'s not alone down there. He shoots an arrow with light towards the dark tunnel and finds hordes of Outriders.]\\n CLINT BARTON: [under his breath] Damn.\\n [Clint takes the gauntlet and runs towards the opposite direction while the Outriders chase after him.]\\n [Scene cuts to the Sanctuary II and it beams Thanos (2014) fully armoured to the ground. Nebula walks towards him.]\\n THANOS (2014): Daughter.\\n NEBULA (2014): Yes, Father.\\n THANOS (2014): So, this is the future. Well done.\\n [Nebula (2014) takes off the orange plate on her head and throws it away]\\n NEBULA (2014): Thank you, Father. They suspected nothing.\\n [Thanos (2014) plants his double-bladed sword on the ground, takes off his helmet and places on top of the sword\\'s edge.]\\n THANOS (2014): The arrogant never do.\\n [Thanos then sits down]\\n THANOS (2014): Go. Find the stones. Bring them to me.\\n NEBULA (2014): What will you do?\\n THANOS (2014): Wait.\\n [Nebula (2014) proceeds to go find the stones and the camera pans over the Sanctuary II and we see Gamora (2014) watching. Gamora (2014) heads over to where Nebula is being held prisoner.]\\n GAMORA (2014): Tell me something. In the future, what happens to you and me?\\n NEBULA: I tried to kill you. Several times.\\n [Gamora (2014) rolls her eyes]\\n NEBULA: But eventually,\\nwe become friends. We become sisters.\\n [Gamora (2014) holds out her hand.]\\n GAMORA (2014): \\nCome on. We can stop him.\\n [Nebula takes it]\\n [Scene cuts to Tony walking towards Steve who\\'s unconscious on the ground.]\\n TONY STARK: Come on, buddy. Wake up. That\\'s my man. [He has Cap\\'s shield.] You lose this again, I\\'m keeping it.\\n STEVE ROGERS: What happened?\\n TONY STARK: You messed with time.\\nIt tends to mess back. You\\'ll see.\\n [Tony helps Steve on his feet. They walk up to join Thor, who has been observing Thanos (2014) from a distance.] \\n TONY STARK: What\\'s he been doing?\\n THOR: Absolutely nothing.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Where are the stones?\\n TONY STARK: Somewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn\\'t have them.\\n STEVE ROGERS: So we keep it that way.\\n THOR: You know it\\'s a trap, right?\\n TONY STARK: Yeah. And I don\\'t much care.\\n THOR: Good. Just as long we are all in agreement. [Thunder cracks as Thor stretches out both hands to summon both Stormbreaker and Mjolnir (2013). His casual clothes transform into his armour and cape, with his beard getting some braid treatment.] Let\\'s kill him properly this time.\\n [The Big Three walk over to confront Thanos face to face]\\n THANOS (2014): You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Back to me. I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you’ve shown me that’s impossible. And as long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist.\\n TONY STARK: Yep. We\\'re all kinds of stubborn.\\n THANOS (2014): I\\'m thankful. Because now, I know\\nwhat I must do. [stands up] I will shred this universe\\ndown to its last atom. [Thanos (2014) puts on his helmet] And then– With the stones you\\'ve collected\\nfor me, create a new one. Teeming with life, but knows not what it has lost\\nbut only what it has been given. [Thor lights himself up.] A grateful universe.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Born out of blood.\\n THANOS (2014): They\\'ll never know it. Because you won\\'t be\\nalive to tell them.\\n [The fighting starts, and Thor and Tony go straight at Thanos (2014). Meanwhile, Hulk is under all of the mess trying to hold up the structure. Rhodey and Rocket are breathing for their lives.]\\n RHODEY: See you on the other side, man.\\n SCOTT LANG: Hang on! I\\'m coming!\\n [Hawkeye is running with the infinity gauntlet. He blows the place, and escapes before the Outriders overwhelm him. He sees Nebula.]\\n CLINT BARTON: Oh, hey– I know you.\\n [Clint gives her the gauntlet. then she puts her hand on her earpiece]\\n NEBULA: Father.\\n [Clint gasped and finds out that she\\'s from 2014]\\n NEBULA (2014): I have the stones.\\n CLINT BARTON: What?!\\n [Clint tries to get up but Nebula (2014) steps her foot down on him an points her gun at him]\\n GAMORA (2014): Stop.\\n [Gamora (2014) come around the corner]\\n NEBULA (2014): You\\'re betraying us?\\n [With her hands up, Nebula joins Gamora (2014). Nebula (2014) points her gun at her future self]\\n NEBULA: You don\\'t have to do this.\\n NEBULA (2014): I am this.\\n GAMORA (2014): No, you\\'re not.\\n NEBULA: You\\'ve seen what we become.\\n GAMORA (2014): Nebula, listen to her.\\n NEBULA: You can change.\\n NEBULA (2014): He won\\'t let me.\\n [Nebula (2014) points a gun at Gamora (2014)]\\n GAMORA (2014): NO!\\n [Present Nebula shoots Nebula (2014) and she dies. Hawkeye picks up the Infinity Gauntlet]\\n [Cut to the 3 heroes battling Thanos]\\n TONY STARK: Okay, Thor. Hit me.\\n [Thor bangs his 2 hammers together combined with his lightning. Tony\\'s suit sucks up the energy and he shoots it out using his hands and his body. Thanos twirls his blade really fast to divert the energy. Thor grabs Stormbreaker and uses it to bat Mjölnir to hit Thanos. Thanos uses Tony as a shield resulting in damage to his system.]\\n F.R.I.D.A.Y: Boss, wake up!\\n [Steve tries to attack Thanos but is easily shielded away by the Mad Titan. Thor\\'s attack on Thanos is blocked by his sword. Thor is beaten and choked by Thanos, as he punches him. Mjolnir is flicked away as Thanos relentlessly beats up Thor, throwing him into a tree and socking him before throwing him over rubble and socking him again. Thor tries to grab Stormbreaker but Thanos grabs it and uses it against Thor as he tries to defend himself. Mjölnir (2013) starts to float off the ground while Thanos is digging it into Thor, when suddenly Mjolnir flies into Thanos, zooms past, stops, and flies back, both look on in amazement as Steve picks up the hammer.]\\n THOR: I knew it!\\n [Thanos\\' (2014) kicks Thor to the ground and proceed to battle Steve dual wielding both his shield and Mjolnir (2013)]\\n [Steve proceeds to charge at Thanos swinging Mjolnir (2013) and hitting Thanos in the face knocking him down. Steve throws his shield and Thanos (2014) deflects, Steve throws Mjolnir (2013) to his shield creating a shockwave and knocking Thanos (2014) off his feet. Steve goes on the offensive on Thanos, throwing his shield first at Thanos and quickly hitting it back at him again with Mjolnir. He lines his arm back up and underarms a channel of lightning on Thanos.]\\n [Thanos eventually gets the upper hand, he removes his helmet, stabs Steve on the leg and knocks Mjolnir (2013) out of his hand. Thanos proceed to destroy Steve\\'s shield with his double-bladed sword and throws him across the battlefield.]\\n [Steve staggeredly tries to get up.]\\n THANOS (2014): In all my years of conquest– violence– slaughter– It was never personal. But I\\'ll tell you now– what I\\'m about to do to your stubborn, annoying little planet– I\\'m gonna enjoy it. Very, very much.\\n [Thanos\\' (2014) entire army is summons to the ground which include the Children of Thanos, Chitauri, Sakaarans, Outriders and Chitauri Gorillas. Upon seeing the army descending on Earth, Steve slowly gets back to his feet. With a fierce determination, he tightens his broken shield to his arm and stands against Thanos\\' giant army alone. Suddenly, a crackling comes in on his communicator.]\\n SAM WILSON: Hey, Cap, you read me?\\n [Steve stops and looks around] \\n SAM WILSON: Cap, it\\'s Sam. Can you hear me?\\n [A yellow portal begins to form behind him.]\\n SAM WILSON: On your left.\\n [Steve looks behind to see the portal on his left side. Three figures step through; Okoye, Shuri, and Black Panther, fully restored and ready to fight. Steve and the revived Wakandans share a look when Sam zooms in from above in his Falcon armor. As he does, we see dozens more portals opening up all around the battlefield. Through one of these, we see Doctor Strange descend in. He is joined by Drax, Mantis, Star Lord, and Spider-Man. Everyone watches in confusion and awe as more and more heroes arrive from all corners of the universe, all backed up with forces of their own including Black Panther and his Wakandan army, Valkyrie and the Asgardians, Wong and the Masters of the Mystic Arts and several Ravager ships. Amongst the throngs of heroes we see Bucky, Groot, the Scarlet Witch, the Wasp, and Pepper Potts (clad in her own iron suit) arrive. Nearly every hero has magically been transported to the battlefield to face Thanos\\' hordes.]\\n DOCTOR STRANGE: Is that everyone?\\n WONG: What, you wanted more?\\n [Giant-Man emerges from the rubble of the Avengers facility with Professor Hulk, War Machine, and Rocket. The Avengers, Guardians, Wakandans, Asgardians, and Ravagers take up battle positions. The heroes standing across Thanos\\' forces.]\\n STEVE ROGERS: AVENGERS! [he summons Mjolnir] –assemble.\\n [Thor makes a battle cry, as does Black Panther and the heroes charge, the Avengers theme swelling with their stride. Thanos raises his sword towards them, commanding his army to charge as well. Then both sides collide. The camera switches between the meet-line, Drax and Korg, Pepper and Tony, all which are battling against Thanos\\' army.]\\n [Cuts to Steve and Thor fighting. Steve takes Stormbreaker but Thor flies to him and passes Mjolnir]\\n THOR: No, no, give me that. You have the little one. [best meme ever]\\n [Later, Tony Stark is seen fighting some of Thanos\\' army. But Cull Obsidian punches him to the ground, then Giant-Man stomps him flat and Peter Parker runs to Tony.]\\n PETER PARKER: Hey! Holy cow! You will not believe what\\'s been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? I must\\'ve passed out, Because I woke up, and you were gone. But Doctor Strange was there, right? He was like, \"It\\'s been five years. Come on, they need us.\" And then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing that he does all the time–\\n TONY STARK: He did? Oh, God.\\n PETER PARKER: What are you doing?\\n [Tony hugs Peter, making him shocked, but he hugs Tony back.]\\n PETER PARKER: Oh, this is nice.\\n [Cut to Star-Lord Fighting a bunch of Sakaarans, killing all of them except one, which makes him fall over, but a off-screen shot kills him and he drops on Peter. Peter gets up and sees Gamora (2014). Thinking its present Gamora, he is shocked.]\\n PETER QUILL: Gamora? [Peter slowly approaches Gamora (2014)] I thought I lost you.\\n [Peter touches Gamora\\'s hair, not knowing she isn\\'t present Gamora. In response, Gamora (2014) grabs Peter\\'s hand firmly off her hair.]\\n PETER QUILL: Ow.\\n GAMORA (2014): [Kicks Peter in the nuts, slightly hurting Peter] Don\\'t– touch– [Kicks him again, this time harder] me!\\n [Peter falls from the pain, while Gamora (2014) wipes her face.]\\n PETER QUILL: You missed the first time– Then you got them both the second time.\\n GAMORA (2014): [to Nebula] This is the one? Seriously?\\n NEBULA: The choices were him, or a tree.\\n [Peter pointing to Gamora (2014) in confusion, then to Nebula in question, and then back to Gamora (2014).]\\n [Later, Clint is seen running with the gauntlet]\\n CLINT BARTON: Cap, what do you want me to do with this damn thing?\\n STEVE ROGERS: Get those stones as far away as possible!\\n BRUCE BANNER: No! We need to get them back where they came from.\\n TONY STARK: No way to get them back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.\\n SCOTT LANG: Hold on! [Scott shrinks to normal size and pulls out a remote.] That wasn\\'t our only time machine.\\n [Scott presses the button, which activates Luis\\'s van\\'s Horn with the song La Cucaracha, which is heard from afar. Hearing so, Cap goes to higher ground.]\\n STEVE ROGERS: Anyone see an ugly, brown van up there?\\n VALKYRIE: Yes! But you\\'re not gonna like where it\\'s parked!\\n TONY STARK: Scott, how long you need to get that thing working?\\n SCOTT LANG: Maybe ten minutes.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Get it started. We\\'ll get the stones to you.\\n HOPE VAN DYNE: We\\'re on it, Cap.\\n [Scott and Hope share a look and they shrink. Scott grabs Hope, and they fly to the van. Doctor Strange traps a group of Chitauri in his magic and sends them through portals as Tony joins him.]\\n TONY STARK: Hey. You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah? Tell me this is it.\\n DOCTOR STRANGE: If I tell you what happens, it won\\'t happen.\\n TONY STARK: You better be right.\\n [Cut to Scott and Hope entering a small hole in the van\\'s window, getting to the drive seat, regrowing and trying to activate the Quantum Tunnel.]\\n THE WASP: It\\'s a mess back here.\\n SCOTT LANG: It\\'s– it\\'s dead.\\n THE WASP: What?\\n SCOTT LANG: It\\'s dead. I have to hotwire it.\\n THANOS (2014): Where\\'s Nebula?\\n CORVUS GLAIVE: She\\'s not responding.\\n EBONY MAW (2014): [pointing.] Sire!\\n [Thanos sees the gauntlet. Clint rushes through Outriders, before finding himself surrounded. He is saved by Black Panther.] \\n T\\'CHALLA: Clint! Give it to me.\\n [Clint gives the Gauntlet to T\\'Challa, and he runs towards the van while fighting Thanos\\' army. Eventually he is stopped by the double edged sword, boomeranged by Thanos. When it gets back to him, he charges T\\'Challa, but is stopped by Wanda, who is filled with anger for the loss of Vision.]\\n WANDA MAXIMOFF: You took everything from me.\\n THANOS (2014): I don\\'t even know who you are.\\n WANDA MAXIMOFF: You will.\\n [With her powers, Wanda picks up some debris on the ground and tries to crush Thanos with it.]\\n [Ebony May grabs the Gauntlet with his telekinesis of bricks. He does the same for T\\'Challa, trying to stop him from getting the glove.]\\n PETER PARKER: I got it!\\n [Peter grabs the Gauntlet with his webshooters and is surrounded by Chitauri.]\\n PETER PARKER: Activate Instant Kill!\\n [The Robotic Spider Legs come out of his back, stabbing the Chitauri.]\\n [Thanos tries to kill Wanda with his double-bladed sword, but Wanda pushes it away. She then uses her powers to try and crush Thanos.]\\n THANOS (2014): Rain fire!\\n CORVUS GLAIVE: But sire, our troops!\\n THANOS (2014): Just do it!\\n [The spaceship cannons appear and start to fire at the heroes. It flings Maximoff away. Wong makes a shield and holds it up. The others do the same. Suddenly one of the cannons hit a dam. Water starts to flood into the battlefield. Pepper is the first to notice.]\\n PEPPER POTTS: Uh, is anyone else seeing this?\\n [Doctor Strange looks at the broken dam and uses his magic to stop the water from flooding the battlefield. Meanwhile, Peter is still battling the Chitauri.]\\n PETER PARKER: I got this. I got this! Okay, I don\\'t got this. Help! Somebody, help!\\n STEVE: Hey, Queens, heads up.\\n [Steve throws Mjolnir, and Peter shoots a web and glides along, then Pepper Potts catches him]\\n PEPPER POTTS: Hang on. I got you, kid. [She drops him on Valkyrie\\'s Pegasus]\\n PETER PARKER: Hey! Nice to meet you– OH, MY GOD!\\n [The cannons knock Peter Parker off the Pegasus, then they turn to face something in the sky as all the cannons start shooting at something.]\\n SAM: What the hell is this?\\n TONY STARK: F.R.I.D.A.Y., what are they firing at?\\n F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Something just entered the upper atmosphere.\\n [A bright light of thundering energy comes surging down as Carol Danvers flies through the ship, and it results in an explosion and the ship crash-landing in the lake]\\n ROCKET: Oh, yeah!\\n STEVE ROGERS: Danvers, we need an assist here.\\n [Cut to Scott finally activating the Quantum Tunnel. Then cut to Carol Danvers landing near Peter, who is on the ground, weirdly hugging the gauntlet with his body.]\\n PETER PARKER: Hi. I\\'m– Peter Parker.\\n CAROL DANVERS: Hey, Peter Parker. You got something for me?\\n PETER PARKER: [Gets up and passes her the gauntlet] I don\\'t know how you\\'re gonna get it through all that.\\n [Wanda arrives, Valkyrie flying on her Pegasus as she arrives.]\\n WANDA MAXIMOFF: Don\\'t worry.\\n OKOYE: She\\'s got help.\\n [Pepper lands next to Okoye, followed by Mantis, Shuri, the Wasp, 2014 Gamora and Nebula. Thanos\\' army charges while the women help Carol Danvers go through the Outriders, Sakaarans and Chitauri. 2014 Gamora takes out a gorilla, while Okoye takes out Corvus Glaive. Wanda and Valkyrie destroy two leviathans. Carol Danvers then starts flying towards the van with the Gauntlet, flying past enemies and going through enemy blockades that are in her way with ease. Thanos, seeing this, starts running to Carol Danvers, but is stopped by Pepper, Shuri and The Wasp, who blast him backwards. Thanos, after seeing Carol Danvers fly past him, throws his double sword at the van, destroying it and the quantum realm tunnel, throwing Carol Danvers backwards and losing her grip on the Gauntlet, which falls to the ground. Doctor Strange steadies the water after the explosion. In the final brawl for the Stark Gauntlet, Stark moves one of Thanos\\' enemies aside and sees the Gauntlet. He runs to get it, but sees Thanos, who Stark tackles. Thanos smacks Stark away, knocking him out. Then Thor arrives with Stormbreaker and 2013 Mjolnir in an attempt to pin Thanos\\' arm down, with assistance from Captain America. However, Thanos overpowers them and knocks them both out. After picking up the Gauntlet, Carol Danvers arrives, punching away at Thanos while he is holding the Gauntlet. She keeps punching him, but Thanos grabs her by the arm and flings her away. Thanos puts on the gauntlet, gamma radiation from the stones eating at him as he tries to snap, but Carol Danvers arises again, and stops his fingers from snapping, opening up his hand similar to what Captain America did in Avengers: Infinity War. Thanos headbutts her, but it does nothing. Just as Carol Danvers is gaining the upper hand by rising up and forcing Thanos onto his knees, Thanos pulls the Power Stone out of the Gauntlet and uses it in his free hand to hit Carol Danvers away. Stark looks in question at Strange, who simply raises one finger, reminding him that the one win over Thanos he foresaw is now at risk. Or is it? Stark nods. Thanos puts the Power Stone back into the Gauntlet, yelling from the gamma radiation coursing through him, until Stark makes one last attack on Thanos, pulling on the Gauntlet before Thanos punches him away.]\\n THANOS (2014): I am– inevitable.\\n [Thanos snaps his fingers, but nothing happens except a metallic \"clink.\" He sees the Infinity Stones are missing. Tony has the stones on his own gauntlet, the gamma radiation coursing through him, to Thanos\\' shock.]\\n TONY STARK: And I– am– Iron Man.\\n [Tony snaps his fingers with a loud \"CLANG\" and a blinding flash of white. Rocket fires at a Leviathan and before it devours him, it crumbles into ash. The Black Order starts crumbling to ash. T\\'Challa and Quill look around in surprise; Steve looks on in exhaustion, knowing that they have won. Thanos, in horror, looks around and sees his entire army disintegrate. He looks at Steve, who just stares at him. Thanos sits down and mourns before slowly being erased from existence himself.]\\n [Cut back to Tony. The power of the gauntlet raw energy has left his entire right side fatally injured. He stumbles for a bit before his body collapses besides a pile of debris. Rhodey soon flies in and goes up to Tony to see his long time colleague and friend fading away. He bows his head, knowing the damage was done. Peter Parker soon flies in and sees Tony collapsed on the ground.]\\n PETER PARKER: Mr. Stark? [He runs up to his fallen mentor. Tears start to form in his eyes] Hey– Mr. Stark? Can you hear me? It\\'s Peter. Hey. We won, Mr. Stark– We won, Mr. Stark. We won. You did it, sir. You did it. [He kneels]\\n [Tony is unresponsive. Peter breaks down and hugs him.]\\n PETER PARKER: I\\'m sorry– Tony–\\n [Peter is gently led aside to grieve. Pepper Potts sits in front of the fading Iron Man.]\\n PEPPER POTTS: Hey.\\n [Tony is barely able to move his head, but manages to look Pepper in the eyes]\\n TONY STARK: [quietly] Hey, Pep..\\n [Pepper places her hand on Tony\\'s Arc Reactor and Tony rests his hand on hers. Pepper takes a good look at Tony\\'s fatal injuries.]\\n [pepper kneels]\\n PEPPER POTTS: F.R.I.D.A.Y.?\\n F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Life functions critical.\\n [Tony smiles with tears in his eyes.]\\n PEPPER POTTS: Tony. Look at me. [She makes sure Tony gets a long look at her smiling face] We\\'re gonna be okay. You can rest now.\\n [With that acknowledgement, Tony\\'s arc reactor flickers off for good. Pepper can no longer contain her grief and starts crying on his shoulder. Tony Stark, Iron Man, Earth\\'s Best Defender, died. All the heroes gather, and kneel in honor of Tony.]\\n [We cut to a montage showing reunions and celebrations. At Clint Barton\\'s farm, he joyfully reunites with his family. At Peter Parker\\'s school, Peter and Ned meet in the hallways. They share a handshake before giving each other a heartfelt hug. In San Francisco, Scott Lang watches fireworks with Cassie Lang and Hope Van Dyne. In Wakanda, T\\'Cahlla, Shuri, and Ramonda oversee the celebrations from their balcony. Over all this, we hear Tony\\'s voice narrating.]\\n TONY STARK (voiceover): Everybody wants a happy ending, right? But it doesn\\'t always roll that way. Maybe this time. I\\'m hoping if you play this back, it\\'s in celebration. I hope families are reunited, I hope we get it back, and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored. If there ever was such a thing. God, what a world. Universe, now. If you told me ten years ago that we weren\\'t alone, let alone, you know, to this extent, I mean, I wouldn\\'t have been surprised. But come on, you know? The epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play. And, for better or worse, that\\'s the reality Morgan\\'s gonna have to find a way to grow up in.\\n [Cut to the Stark household. Pepper, Morgan, Happy Hogan, and Rhodey all watch Tony\\'s holographic message being projected from his Iron Man helmet. Tony is sitting down recording the message.]\\n TONY STARK (hologram): So I thought I\\'d probably better record a little greeting... In the case of an untimely death on my part. I mean, not that, death at any time isn\\'t untimely. This time travel thing that we\\'re gonna try and pull off tomorrow, it\\'s– it\\'s got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all. That\\'s the thing. Then again, that\\'s the hero gig. Part of the journey is the end. [Tony suddenly gets up walking towards his camera] What am I even trippin\\' for? Everything\\'s gonna work out exactly the way it\\'s supposed to. [He leans down and smiles. He is looking straight at Morgan] I love you 3,000.\\n [The message ends and the hologram cuts out.]\\n [Cut to outside the cottage. Pepper carries a wreath out of the house to an audience waiting outside for the intimate funeral. She lays the wreath on the lake. On top of the wreath is Tony\\'s first arc reactor which Pepper had framed with the words \"Proof That Tony Stark Has a Heart\" back in 2008. The camera slowly pans to see Pepper, Morgan, Happy Hogan, & Rhodey, all being joined by Steve Rogers, Peter Parker, May Parker, Thor, Bruce Banner, Doctor Strange, Wong, Scott Lang, Hope Van Dyne, Janet Van Dyne, Hank Pym, Peter Quill, Nebula, Rocket, Teenage Groot, Drax, Mantis, T\\'Challa, Okoye, Shuri, Clint Barton & his family, Wanda Maximoff, Bucky Barnes, Sam Wilson, Harley Keener, Secretary Ross, Maria Hill, Carol Danvers, and Nick Fury, silently watching the wreath float away.]\\n [Cut to Clint and Wanda, standing by the riverside shortly afterwards.]\\n CLINT: You know, I wish there was a way– that I could let her know. That we won. [Looks over to Wanda.] We did it.\\n WANDA MAXIMOFF: She knows– They both do.\\n [Clint gives her a side hug and Wanda reciprocates.]\\n [scene cuts to Happy and Morgan.]\\n HAPPY: How you doing, Squirt?\\n MORGAN STARK: Good.\\n HAPPY: You good? Okay. You hungry?\\n MORGAN STARK: Mm. Hm.\\n HAPPY: What do you want?\\n MORGAN STARK: Cheeseburgers.\\n HAPPY: You know your dad liked cheeseburgers? I\\'m gonna get you all the cheeseburgers you want.\\n MORGAN STARK: Okay.\\n [Following the funeral for Tony, we cut to Thor and Valkyrie in New Asgard.]\\n VALKYRIE: So, when can we expect you back?\\n THOR: Um– about that–\\n VALKYRIE: Thor. Your people need a king.\\n THOR: No, they already have one.\\n VALKYRIE: That\\'s funny. You\\'re being serious?\\n [Thor nods his head]\\n THOR: It\\'s time for me to be who I am rather than who I\\'m supposed to be. But you, you\\'re a leader. That\\'s who you are.\\n VALKYRIE: You know I\\'d make a lot of changes around here.\\n THOR: I\\'m counting on it. Your Majesty.\\n [Thor offers Valkyrie a farewell handshake]\\n VALKYRIE: What will you do?\\n THOR: I\\'m not sure. For the first time in a thousand years, I– I have no path. I do have a ride, though.\\n [Camera pans to the Benatar parked on the cliff]\\n ROCKET: Move it or lose it, hairbag.\\n [scene cuts to Quill searching for Gamora on the screen as Thor walks in he closes it]\\n THOR: Well, here we are. Tree! Good to see you. Well– [Thor removes his shades and taps Quill on the shoulder] The Asgardians of the Galaxy, back together again. Where to first? [Thor touches the screens map to pick their destination]\\n QUILL: Hey, just so you know, this is my ship still. I\\'m in charge.\\n THOR: I know. I know. Of course, you are. Of course.\\n QUILL: See, you say of course, but then you touch the map. It makes you think that maybe you didn\\'t realize I was in charge.\\n THOR: Quail– you– that– that\\'s your own–\\n QUILL: Quail?\\n THOR: –insecurities in there. Okay? I\\'m merely trying to be of service and assisting.\\n QUILL: It\\'s Quill.\\n THOR: That\\'s what I said.\\n DRAX: You should fight one another for the honor of leadership.\\n NEBULA: Sounds fair.\\n [Quill looks around]\\n QUILL: It\\'s not necessary.\\n THOR: It\\'s not.\\n QUILL: Okay?\\n ROCKET: I got some blasters, unless you guys wanna use knives.\\n MANTIS: [enthusiastically] Oooh, yes. Please, use knives.\\n DRAX: Yeah, knives.\\n GROOT: I am Groot.\\n [Both Thor and Quill laugh but Quill tries to laugh harder]\\n QUILL: Not necessary...\\n THOR: There shall be no knifing one another. Everybody knows who\\'s in charge.\\n QUILL: [glances at Thor] Me, right?\\n THOR: Yes, you. Of course. Of course. Of course.\\n [Scene cuts to Bruce, Steve, Sam and Bucky at the funeral]\\n BRUCE BANNER: Now, remember– You have to return the stones to the exact moment you got them. Or you\\'re gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Don\\'t worry, Bruce. Clip all the branches.\\n BRUCE BANNER: You know, I tried. When I had the gauntlet, the stones, I really tried to bring her back. [Looks at Steve] I miss her, man.\\n STEVE ROGERS: Me, too.\\n SAM WILSON: You know, if you want, I can come with you.\\n STEVE ROGERS: You\\'re a good man, Sam. This one\\'s on me, though.\\n [Steve goes over to Bucky]\\n STEVE ROGERS: Don\\'t do anything stupid \\'till I get back.\\n BUCKY BARNES: How can I? You\\'re taking all the stupid with you.\\n [They both hug each other]\\n BUCKY BARNES: Gonna miss you, Buddy.\\n STEVE ROGERS: It\\'s gonna be okay, Buck.\\n [Steve goes over to the Quantum portal and dons the Quantum suit]\\n SAM WILSON: How long is this gonna take?\\n BRUCE BANNER: For him? As long as he needs. For us? Five seconds.\\n [Steve picks up Mjolnir (2013)]\\n BRUCE BANNER: Ready, Cap? Alright. We\\'ll meet\\nyou back here, okay?\\n STEVE ROGERS: You bet.\\n BRUCE BANNER: Going quantum. Three, two, one–\\n [Steve disappears into the Quantum portal]\\n BRUCE BANNER: And returning in, five, four, three, two, one–\\n [Steve doesn\\'t appear on the pad. Bruce looks around the equipment]\\n SAM WILSON: Where is he?\\n BRUCE BANNER: I don\\'t know. He blew right by his time stamp. He should be here.\\n [Bucky turns around from the pad]\\n SAM WILSON: Well, get him back.\\n BRUCE BANNER: I\\'m trying.\\n SAM WILSON: Get him the hell back!\\n BRUCE BANNER: Hey, I said, I\\'m trying!\\n BUCKY BARNES: Sam...\\n [Sam walks toward Bucky. Sam, Bucky, and Bruce see old looking Steve sitting on a log. Sam and Bucky go near him.]\\n BUCKY BARNES: Go ahead.\\n [Bucky has a smile forming and looks over to Sam. He walks towards the old man and instantly recognizes the now-elderly Steve Rogers]\\n SAM WILSON: Cap?\\n (OLD) STEVE ROGERS: Hi, Sam.\\n [Old Steve looks over to Sam]\\n SAM WILSON: So did something go wrong, or did something go right?\\n (OLD) STEVE ROGERS: Well, after I put the stones back, I thought, maybe I\\'ll try some of that life Tony was telling me to get.\\n SAM WILSON: How\\'d that work out for you?\\n (OLD) STEVE ROGERS: It was beautiful.\\n SAM WILSON: I\\'m happy for you. Truly.\\n (OLD) STEVE ROGERS: Thank you.\\n SAM WILSON: Only thing bumming me out is the fact I have to live in a world without Captain America.\\n (OLD) STEVE ROGERS: Oh, That reminds me. [brings out his shield.] Try it on.\\n [Sam look over to Bucky, who nods, and Sam holds Steve\\'s shield.]\\n (OLD) STEVE ROGERS: How does it feel?\\n SAM WILSON: Like it\\'s someone else\\'s.\\n (OLD) STEVE ROGERS: It isn\\'t.\\n [Sam tries to hold back tears]\\n SAM WILSON: Thank you. I\\'ll do my best.\\n (OLD) STEVE ROGERS: That\\'s why it\\'s yours. [shakes Sam\\'s hand]\\n SAM WILSON: [seeing elderly Steve\\'s wedding ring] You wanna tell me about her?\\n (OLD) STEVE ROGERS: [smiling] No. No, I don\\'t think I will.\\n [In the final scenes, Steve has time traveled back to the 1940s to be with Peggy Carter. They are seen dancing to \"It\\'s Been a Long, Long Time\" in their home, and they end with a kiss.] – \"It\\'s Been a Long, Long Time\" performed by Harry James and His Orchestra, sung by Kitty Kallen, written by Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne\\n [In the very end of the film, the sound of hammering metal is heard in the background. A dedication to Tony Stark.]\\n [Closing Title: Marvel Studios]\\n [Screen Title: Distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]\\n The End.\\n']}"

       "'[Missouri, Earth, 1980. Meredith Quill & Ego are driving along a dirt road in Missouri singing along to \"Brandy you\\'re a fine girl\" by Looking Glass. The two get out of the car and run into a forest.]\\n Meredith Quill: Where are you taking me?\\n Ego: Come on, come on. Look!\\n [Meredith spots a seedling that looks not of this Earth.]\\n Meredith: Oh, its beautiful.\\n Ego: I was afraid it wouldnt take to the soil, but it grew quickly and soon, it will be everywhere, all across the universe!\\n Meredith: Well, I dont know what youre talking about, but I like the way you say it.\\n Ego: My heart is yours, Meredith Quill.\\n Meredith: I cant believe that I fell in love with a spaceman.\\n [They kiss]\\n [34 Years Later - The Sovereign, The Guardians of the Galaxy, consisting of Peter \"Star Lord\" Quill, Gamora, Drax and Rocket, stand around waiting for something big to show up.]\\n Peter Quill: Show time, A-holes! it will be here any minute.\\n Gamora: Which it will be its last.\\n Quill: I thought your thing was a sword?\\n Gamora: Weve been hired to stop an inter-dimensional beast from feeding on those batteries and Im going to stop it with a sword?\\n Quill: Its just swords were your thing and guns were mine, but I guess were both doing guns now. I just didnt know that.\\n Gamora: Drax, why arent you wearing one of Rockets Aero-Rigs?\\n Drax the Destroyer: It hurts.\\n Gamora: Hurts?\\n Drax: I have sensitive nipples.\\n Rocket Raccoon: [in a mocking tone] Wa-ha-ha-ha! My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!\\n Drax: What about him, whats he doing?\\n Rocket: Im finishing this so we can listen to tunes while we work.\\n Drax: How is that important?\\n Rocket: Blame Quill, hes the one who loves music so much!\\n Quill: No, I actually agree with Drax on this, thats hardly important right now.\\n Rocket: [winking] Oh, ok, sure Quill\\n Quill: No, seriously, I side with Drax.\\n Rocket: I understand that, your being very serious right now.\\n Drax: I can clearly see you winking!\\n Rocket: Damn, Im using my left eye?\\n [Groot, still a baby terrorizes orloni and looks at Rocket.]\\n Groot: I am Groot.\\n Rocket: They were not looking at you funny. [sees the Abilisk] Oh, well thats intense.\\n [While the Guardians fight off the Abilisk, Baby Groot plugs in the cord to Peter Quill\\'s stereo and starts playing \"Mr. Blue Sky\" by ELO and begins dancing]\\n Quill: Groot!\\n Gamora: Groot, get out of the way your going to get hurt! [Baby Groot waves] Hi!\\n [Baby Groot continues dancing; Drax falls down next to him and every time he looks at Baby Groot, Baby Groot stops dancing. Baby Groot notices a fly buzzing around and he tries to catch it, he grabs it and puts it in his mouth.]\\n Rocket: No, no! Spit it out! Come on! Thats disgusting.\\n [Rocket removes the bug from Baby Groot\\'s mouth. Baby Groot hops on top of an Orloni and hops around the giant Abilisk. Baby Groot jumps off the Orloni and continues dancing until Drax falls on top of Peter Quill\\'s stereo and smashes it; Baby Groot gets angry and tries to kick Drax]\\n Drax: The beasts hide is too thick to be pierced from the outside! I must cut through it from the inside.\\n Gamora: What? No, Drax! Drax!\\n Quill: Whats he doing?!\\n Gamora: He said that the skin is to thick to be pierced on the outside so\\n Quill: That doesnt make any sense!\\n Gamora: I tried telling him that!\\n Quill: Skin has the same level of thickness on the inside as it is on the outside!\\n Gamora: I realize that!\\n Quill: Theres a cut on its neck! Rocket, get it to look up!.\\n Rocket: Alright, you giant sea monkey, up here! Whoa, watch it Quill!\\n Drax: Yes! I have single-handily vanquished the beast! [Groot throws something in his face] What? What are they called again?\\n Quill: Anulax batteries.\\n Drax: Harbulary batteries.\\n Quill: Thats nothing like what I just said. But theyre worth thousands of units apiece which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them. Careful what you say around these folks. Theyre easily offended. The cost of transgression is death.\\n Ayesha: We thank you, Guardians, for putting your lives on the line. We could not risk the lives of our own Sovereign citizens. Every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community. Impeccable, both physically and mentally. We control the DNA of our progeny germinating them in birthing pods.\\n Quill: I guess I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way.\\n Ayesha: Perhaps someday, you could give me a history lesson in the archaic ways of our ancestors. For academic purposes.\\n Quill: I would be honored, yes. In the name of researchI think that could be pretty, uh [notices Gamora staring at him and he quickly changes his answer] repulsive.Im not into that kind of casual\\n Gamora: [interrupting Peter] Oh, please. Your people promised something in exchange for our services. Bring it and we shall gladly be on our way.\\n [The Sovereign guards bring a hooded figure nto the courtroom and throw her on the ground and pull back her hood, to reveal Gamoras sister, Nebula]\\n Quill: Family reunion. Yay.\\n Ayesha: I understand she is your sister.\\n Gamora: Shes worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar.\\n Ayesha: Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries. Do with her as you please.\\n Quill: We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.\\n Ayesha: What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?\\n Quill: My mother is from Earth.\\n Ayesha: And your father?\\n Quill: He aint from Missouri. Thats all I know.\\n Ayesha: I see it within you. An unorthodox genealogy. A hybrid that seems particularly reckless.\\n Rocket: [after hearing Ayesha insulted Peter] You know, they told me you people were conceited douchebags, but that isnt true at all. [Winks] Oh, shit. Im using my wrong eye again, arent I? Im sorry. [Drax picks Rocket up from the scruff of his vest and carries him briefly] That was meant to be behind your back. [Drax puts Rocket down]\\n Drax: Count yourself blessed they didnt kill you.\\n Rocket: Youre telling me. [shows Drax the batteries] You wanna buy some batteries? [Drax laughs out loud but Rocket quickly shushes him. On The Milano, \"Lake Shore Drive\" plays] All right, lets get baldy to Xandar and collect that bounty.\\n Quill: That stuff about my father Who does she think she is?\\n Gamora: I know youre sensitive about that.\\n Quill: Im not sensitive about it. I just dont know who he is. Sorry if it seemed like I was flirting with the High Priestess. I wasnt.\\n Gamora: I dont care if you were.\\n Quill: Well, I feel like you do care. Thats why Im apologizing. So, sorry!\\n Drax: Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.\\n Quill: Damn shadow.\\n Drax: There are two types of beings in the universe those who dance, and those who do not.\\n Quill: Mmm-hmm.\\n Drax: I first met my beloved at a war rally.\\n Quill: Oh, God.\\n Drax: Everyone in the village flailed about, dancing. Except one woman. My Ovette. I knew immediately she was the one for me. The most melodic song in the world could be playing. She wouldnt even tap her foot. Wouldnt move a muscle. One might assume she was dead.\\n Quill: That does sound pretty hot.\\n Drax: It would make my nether regions engorge.\\n Quill: Okay. I get it, yes. Im a dancer, Gamora is not.\\n Drax: You just need to find a woman who is pathetic like you.\\n Quill: Mmm.\\n Nebula: Im hungry. Hand me some of that yaro root.\\n Gamora: No. Its not ripe yet and I hate you.\\n Nebula: You hate me? You left me there while you stole that stone for yourself. And yet here you stand, a hero. I will be free of these shackles soon enough, and I will kill you. I swear.\\n Gamora: No. Youre gonna live out the rest of your days in a prison on Xandar wishing you could.\\n Quill: This is weird, we got a Sovereign fleet approaching from the rear.\\n Gamora: Why would they do that?\\n Drax: Probably cause Rocket stole some of their batteries.\\n Rocket: Dude!\\n Drax: [awkwardly] Right he didnt steal some of those. I dont know why theyre after us, what a mystery this is.\\n Quill: What were you thinking?\\n Rocket: Dude, they were really easy to steal!\\n Gamora: Thats your defense?\\n Rocket: Come on! You saw how that High Priestess talked down to us. Now Im teaching her a lesson!\\n Quill: I didnt realize your motivation was altruism. Its really a shame the Sovereigns mistaking your intentions and theyre trying to kill us.\\n Rocket: Exactly.\\n Quill: I was being sarcastic!\\n Rocket: Oh, no! Youre supposed to use a sarcastic voice! Now I look foolish!\\n Gamora: Can your bickering on a hold until after we survive this massive space battle?\\n Quill: More incoming!\\n Rocket: Good, I want to kill some guys!\\n Sovereign Woman: Damn it!\\n Ayesha: What is the delay, Admiral?\\n Sovereign Admiral: High Priestess, the batteries, they are exceptionally combustible and could destroy the entire fleet.\\n Ayesha: Our concern is their slight against our people. We hired them and they steal from us. It is heresy of the highest order.\\n Sovereign Admiral: All command modules fire with the intent to kill.\\n Quill: Whats the nearest habitable planet?\\n Gamora: Its called Berhert.\\n Quill: How many jumps?\\n Gamora: Only one. But the access point is 47 clicks away. And you have to go through that quantum asteroid field.\\n Drax: Quill, to make it through that youd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.\\n Quill: Lucky for us, I\\n Rocket: I am. What are you doing?\\n Quill: Ive been flying this rig since I was 10 years old.\\n Rocket: I was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft.\\n Quill: You were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag!\\n Gamora: Stop it.\\n Rocket: Later on tonight, youre gonna be laying down, theres gonna be something squishy in your pillowcase. And youre gonna be like, \"whats this?\", and its gonna be because I put a turd in there.\\n Quill: You put your turd in my bed and I shave you!\\n Rocket: Oh, it wont be my turd. Itll be Draxs.\\n Drax: [laughs] I have famously huge turds!\\n Gamora: Were about to die, and this is what were discussing?\\n Rocket: Son of a\\n Quill: Dude! Seriously!\\n Rocket: Hey! Let me\\n Nebula: Idiots!\\n Rocket: [smiles] Well, thats what you get when Quill flies.\\n [Gamora throws something at Rocket]\\n Gamora: We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.\\n Quill: Our weapons are down.\\n Gamora: 20 clicks to the jump! Hold on.\\n [Nebula tries to steal another fruit, but Drax kicks it out of her grasp.]\\n Drax: Its not ripe.\\n [In Sovereign control, Zylak is one of the few ones controlling a droid.]\\n Zylak\\'s Frenemy Come on, Zylak. You can do this.\\n All Sovereign: Yes!\\n [In the Milano cockpit]\\n Gamora: 15 clicks to the jump!\\n All Sovereign: Come on! Keep going!\\n Gamora: 10 clicks!\\n Drax: Die, spaceship!\\n [Drax hits the ship with his shot and destroys Zylak\\'s ship]\\n Sovereign: You suck, Zylak.\\n Sovereign Woman: Typical.\\n Gamora: Five clicks!\\n Quill: Son of a They went around the field!\\n Sovereign General: Someone destroyed all our ships!\\n Ayesha: What? Who?\\n Gamora: One click!\\n Rocket: What is that?\\n Quill: Who cares? Thats the jump point! Go!\\n Rocket: Its a guy.\\n Gamora: [noticing Drax is still out there] Oh, my God. Hes still out there?\\n Quill: Groot, put your seatbelt on! Prepare for a really bad landing!\\n Drax: [laughing] That was awesome! Yes!\\n [All the Guardians are out of their ship and notice the Milano is destroyed.]\\n Gamora: Look at this! Where is the other half of our ship?\\n Quill: My ship.\\n Gamora: Either one of you could have gotten us through that field had you flown with whats between your ears instead of whats between your legs!\\n Quill: If whats between my legs had a hand on it I guarantee I could have landed this ship with it.\\n Gamora: [in a scolding tone] Peter, we almost died because of your arrogance.\\n Quill: More like because he stole the Anulax batteries!\\n Drax: Theyre called Harbulary batteries.\\n Quill: No, theyre not!\\n Rocket: Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch? Hmm?\\n Quill: I\\'m not gonna answer to \"Star-Munch.\"\\n Rocket: I did it because I wanted to!\\n Quill: Dick.\\n Rocket: What are we even talking about this for? We just had a little man save us by blowing up fifty ships!\\n Drax: How little?\\n Rocket: [holding his thumb and forefinger close together] Well, I don\\'t know, like this?\\n Gamora: [skeptically] A little one-inch man saved us?\\n Rocket: Well, if he got closer, I\\'m sure he would be much larger.\\n Quill: It\\'s how eyesight works, you stupid raccoon.\\n Rocket: Don\\'t call me a racoon!\\n Quill: I\\'m sorry. I took it too far. I meant trash panda.\\n [Rocket looks around in confusion]\\n Rocket: Is that better?\\n Drax: I don\\'t know.\\n Quill: [snickering] It\\'s worse. It\\'s so much worse.\\n Rocket: You son of a\\n Quill: Hey!\\n Rocket: Ive had it with you!\\n Quill: No! Back up!\\n Nebula: [notices a ship coming through] Someone followed you through the jump point. Set me free, youll need my help.\\n Gamora: Im not a fool, Nebula.\\n Nebula: You are a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat.\\n Gamora: Youll attack me the moment I let you go.\\n Nebula: [terrible at lying] No, I wont.\\n Quill: Youd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.\\n Drax: I bet its the one-inch man.\\n Ego: After all these years, Ive found you.\\n Peter Quill: And who the hell are you?\\n Ego: I figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious. My name is Ego and Im your dad, Peter.\\n Howard the Duck: You know what they say \"Youre out of luck until youve gone duck.\"\\n Tullk: Yondu! Come on down!\\n Stakar Ogord: After going around years in circles with this woman I end up marrying. I said, \"Aleta, I love you, girl \"but youre losing your mind!\" Then again, shes always been that way. I could never trust her. You know?\\n Yondu Udonta: Stakar. Its been some time.\\n Stakar: It seems like this establishment is the wrong kind of disreputable.\\n Yondu: Stakar!\\n Stakar: Theres a hundred Ravager factions. You lost the business of 99 of them by serving one.\\n Inn Keeper\\'s Wife: Please, sir. Please!\\n Stakar: Get away from me.\\n Yondu: You can go to hell then. I don\\'t give a damn what you think of me.\\n Stakar: So what are you following us for?\"\\n Yondu: Are you gonna listen to what I gotta say?!\\n Stakar: I don\\'t gotta listen to nothing, you betrayed the code. Ravagers don\\'t deal in kids!\\n Yondu: I told you before, I didn\\'t know what was going on...\\n Stakar: You didn\\'t know cause you didn\\'t wanna know cause that made you rich.\\n Yondu: I demand a seat on the table. I wear these flames, same as you!\\n Stakar: You may dress like us, but you\\'ll never hear the hordes of freedom when you die Yondu, and the colors of Ogord will never flash over your grave. If you think I take pleasure in exiling you, you\\'re wrong. You broke all our hearts.\\n Taserface: Ah, pathetic. First, Quill betrays us and Yondu just lets him go scot-free. We followed him because he was the one who wasnt afraid to do what needed to be done. Seems hes goin soft.\\n Kraglin Obfonteri: If hes so soft, why are you whispering?\\n Taserface: You know Im right, Kraglin.\\n Tullk: You best be very careful what you say about our captain.\\n \\'Ravager: [sees Ayesha] Who the hell is that?\\n Ayesha: Yondu Udonta I have a proposition for you.\\n Ego: I hired Yondu to pick you up when your mother passed away. But instead of returning you, Yondu kept you. I have no clue as to why.\\n Quill: Well, Ill tell you why. Because I was a skinny little kid who could squeeze into places adults couldnt. It made it easier for thievin.\\n Ego: Well, Ive been trying to track you down ever since.\\n Drax: I thought Yondu was your father.\\n Quill: What? Weve been together this whole time and you thought Yondu was my actual blood relative?\\n Drax: You look exactly alike.\\n Rocket Raccoon: Ones blue!\\n Peter Quill: No, hes not my father! Yondu was the guy who abducted me, kicked the crap out of me so I could learn to fight, and kept me in terror by threatening to eat me.\\n Ego: Eat you?\\n Peter Quill: Yeah.\\n Ego: Oh, that son of a bitch.\\n Gamora: Howd you locate us now?\\n Ego: Well, even where I reside, out past the edge of whats known weve heard tell about the man they call Star-Lord. What say we head out there right now? Your associates are welcome. Even that triangle-faced monkey there. I promise you its unlike any other place youve ever seen. And there I can explain your very special heritage. Finally get to be the father Ive always wanted to be. Excuse me. Ive gotta take a whiz. [goes to the bathroom; Peter looks at Gamora, still not believing his father]\\n Quill: Im not buying it.\\n Gamora: Lets go take a walk.\\n Mantis: [smiles; to Drax] I am Mantis.\\n Drax: What are you doing?\\n Mantis: Smiling. I hear it is the thing to do to make people like you.\\n Drax: Not if you do it like that.\\n Mantis: Oh I was raised alone on Egos planet. I do not understand the intricacies of social interaction. Can I pet your puppy? It is adorable.\\n Drax: Yes. That is called a practical joke!\\n Mantis: I liked it very much!\\n Drax: I just made it up!\\n Quill: Give me a break! After all this time, youre gonna show up, and all of a sudden you wanna be my dad?\\n Gamora: I hear you.\\n Quill: And by the way, this could be a trap. The Kree purists, the Ravagers they all want us dead.\\n Gamora:I know, but\\n Quill: But what?\\n Gamora: What was that story you once told me about Zardu Hasselfrau?\\n Quill: Who?\\n Gamora: He owned a magic boat?\\n Quill: [long pause] David Hasselhoff?\\n Gamora: Right.\\n Quill: Not a magic boat. A talking car.\\n Gamora: Why did he talk again?\\n Quill: To help him fight crime, and to be supportive!\\n Gamora: As a child, you would carry his picture in your pocket and you would tell all the other children that he was your father, but that he was out of town.\\n Quill: Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany. I told you that when I was drunk. Why are you bringing that up now?\\n Gamora: I love that story.\\n Quill: I hate that story. Its so sad! As a kid, I used to see all the other kids off playing catch with their dad. And I wanted that, more than anything in the world!\\n Gamora: Thats my point, Peter. What if this man is your Hasselhoff? If he ends up being evil we will just kill him.\\n Nebula: Youre leaving me with that fox?\\n Gamora: Hes not a fox. Shoot her if she does anything suspicious. Or if you feel like it.\\n Rocket: Okay.\\n Gamora: [to Groot] Itll be just a couple of days. Well be back before Rockets finished fixing the ship. [Groot gives her a sad smile and wave.]\\n Drax: What if the Sovereign come?\\n Quill: Theres no way for them to know were here. Lets go.\\n Drax: Im uncertain about parting ways.\\n Quill: God, youre like an old woman.\\n Drax: Because Im wise?\\n Gamora: Why do you have so much luggage?\\n Drax: I dont want Groot playing with my things.\\n Rocket: I hope Daddy isnt as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.\\n Quill: What is your goal here? To get everybody to hate you? Because its working.\\n [Quill, Gamora and Drax enter Ego\\'s ship, which immediately takes off.]\\n Quill: Hey, can I ask you a personal question?\\n Mantis: [shocked] Oh No one has ever asked me a personal question.\\n Quill: Your antennas. What are they for?\\n Mantis: Their purpose?\\n Drax: Yes. Quill and I have a bet.\\n Quill: Dude. You\\'re not supposed to say that\\n Drax: I say: if you are about to go through a doorway that is too low, your antennae will feel this, and keep you from being decapitated.\\n Quill: Right, and if it\\'s anything other than specifically not being decapitated by a doorway, I win.\\n Mantis: They are not for feeling doorways! [Drax groans, Peter laughs] I think they have something to do with my empathic abilities.\\n Gamora: What are those?\\n Mantis: If I touch someone, I can feel their feelings.\\n Quill: You read minds?\\n Mantis: No. Telepaths know thoughts. Empaths feel feelings, emotions. May I?\\n Quill: Alright.\\n Mantis: [touches Quill\\'s hand; as she feels his feelings, her antennas lit up] You feel love!\\n Quill: Yeah, I guess I feel a general, unselfish love for just about everybody around me.\\n Mantis: No. Romantic, sexual love\\n Quill: No no, I don\\'t\\n Mantis: For her! [points at Gamora]\\n Quill: No! [Gamora looks surprised] That is not [Drax suddenly starts laughing uproariously] Okay. [Drax continues laughing and points at Peter as he groans] That\\'s\\n Drax: She just told everyone your deepest, darkest secret!\\n Quill: Dude, come on! I think you\\'re overreacting a little bit.\\n Drax: You must be so embarrassed!\\n [Drax continues cackling as Gamora is in amusement]\\n Drax: [to Mantis] Do me! Do me, do me!\\n [She reaches over and touches his chest, and immediately starts laughing along with him]\\n Mantis: I have never felt such humor!\\n [Drax and Mantis are laughing and pointing at Peter]\\n Quill: [to himself] So unbelievably uncool.\\n Drax: [stops laughing] Oh, Quill\\n [Mantis, who is giggling, walks over to Gamora to touch her]\\n Gamora: [suddenly grabs her wrist] Touch me, and the only thing you\\'re gonna feel is a broken jaw. [pause as Mantis looks scared and looks at Gamora, before she finally lets go of Mantis\\' wrist]\\n Mantis: I can also alter emotions to some extent.\\n Peter Quill: Yeah, like what?\\n Mantis: If I touch someone who is sad, I can ease them into contentment for a short while. I can make a stubborn person compliant. But I mostly use it to help my master sleep. He lies awake at night, thinking about his progeny.\\n Drax: Do one of those on me! [Mantis puts her hand on Drax\\'s head]\\n Mantis: Sleep. [Suddenly, Drax immediately falls asleep and snores loudly]\\n [Scene changes to Rocket on Berhert]\\n Rocket: I love this song.\\n Ravager: Aint so tough now without all your toys are you?\\n Rocket: Crap.\\n Yondu: Hey there, rat!\\n Rocket: How\\'s it goin\\', you blue idiot?\\n Yondu: Not so bad! We got ourselves a pretty good little gig here! This golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself has offered us a large sum to deliver you and your pals over to her, because she wants to kill y\\'all.\\n [All the Ravagers laugh; back to the destroyed Milano]\\n Nebula: [to Baby Groot] Your friend There\\'s too many of them. He needs my help. If you care about him You need to get me out of these bonds. They are going to kill him!\\n Yondu: [to Rocket] I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you. I put a tracer on your ship back there during the war over Xandar.\\n Rocket: Give me your word you won\\'t hurt Groot, and I\\'ll tell you where the batteries are.\\n Yondu: [chuckles a little] Lucky for you, my word don\\'t mean squat. Otherwise, I\\'d actually hand you over.\\n Taserface: Otherwise, you\\'d what?\\n Yondu We\\'ll take them batteries! Theyre worth what? A quarter mill on the open market?\\n Taserface: That Priestess offered us a million! A quarter is only one-third of that!\\n Yondu: A quarter ain\\'t a third\\n Gef: A quarter is 25. [Yondu shakes his head]\\n Yondu: No.\\n Gef: We can\\'t even buy a pair of boots with 25 units.\\n Yondu: Enough! The point is, we ain\\'t stupid enough to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy! The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.\\n Kraglin: [off-screen] That ain\\'t right! I just gotta say it this one time, Cap\\'n No matter how many times Quill betrays you, you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!\\n Ravagers: Yeah!!\\n Kraglin: I\\'m the one what sticks up for you!\\n Tullk: Take it easy, Kraglin.\\n Taserface: Damn straight, lad! He\\'s gone soft. Suppose its time for a change in leadership!\\n [All the Ravagers start agreeing as they cock their guns at each other and Yondu prepares to whistle his Yaka arrow; the Ravagers continue to yell and holding their weapons at each other]\\n Tullk: Put your damn guns down!!\\n Rocket: Whoa! Whoa. There must be some kind of peaceful resolution to this, fellas or even a violent one where I\\'m standing over there.\\n [Suddenly, a blast destroys Yondu\\'s control fin, knocking him unconscious, and we see Nebula behind them.]\\n Nebula: Well, hello boys. [takes a bite of the root she\\'s holding; spits it out] Its not ripe.\\n [George Harrison\\'s \"My Sweet Lord\" plays, as the three Guardians, Ego and Mantis leave the ship, and we see the psychedelic landscape of Ego\\'s planet.]\\n Ego: Welcome, everyone, to my world.\\n Quill: Wow. You have your own planet?\\n Ego: Come on. No larger than your Earths Moon.\\n Drax: Humility. I like it. I, too, am extraordinarily humble.\\n Gamora: You own a planet and can destroy two dozen spaceships without a suit. What are you exactly?\\n Ego: Im whats called a Celestial, sweetheart.\\n Quill: A Celestial, like a god?\\n Ego: Mmm, small \"g,\" son. At least on the days Im feeling humble as Drax. I dont know where I came from exactly. First thing I remember is flickering adrift in the cosmos utterly and entirely alone. Over millions of years I learned to control the molecules around me. I grew smarter and stronger. And I continued building from there layer by layer the very planet you walk on now. But I wanted more. I desired meaning. \"There must be some life out there in the universe besides just me,\" I thought. And so, I set myself the task of finding it. I created what I imagined biological life to be like down to the most minute detail.\\n Drax: Did you make a penis?\\n Quill: Dude!\\n Gamora: What is wrong with you?\\n Drax: If he is a planet, how could he make a baby with your mother? He would smush her!\\n Quill: I dont need to hear how my parents\\n Drax: Why? My father would tell the story of impregnating my mother every winter solstice.\\n Quill: Thats disgusting.\\n Drax: It was beautiful. You Earthers have hang-ups.\\n Ego: Yes, Drax, I got a penis.\\n Drax: Ha! Thank you!\\n Ego: Its not half bad.\\n Drax: Oh.\\n Quill: - Ugh.\\n Ego: Ive also got pain receptors, and a digestive system and all the accompanying junk. I wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human as I set out amongst the stars until I found what I sought. Life. I was not alone in the universe after all.\\n Quill: When did you meet my mother?\\n Ego: Not long after. It was with Meredith that I first experienced love. I called her my river lily. And from that love, Peter you. I have searched for you for so long. And when I heard of a man from Earth who held an Infinity Stone in his hand without dying I knew you must be the son of the woman I loved.\\n Peter Quill: If you loved her, why did you leave her?\\n [Scene changes to the Ravagers\\' ship.]\\n Tullk: This is mutiny! This is mutiny!\\n Oblo: Captain! Help me! Please! Captain!\\n Taserface: You\\'re the one what killed those men by leading them down the wrong path. Because you\\'re weak. And stupid! It\\'s time for the Ravagers to rise once again to glory with a new captain Taserface!\\n Rocket: I\\'m sorry. Your name is It\\'s Taserface?\\n Taserface: That\\'s right.\\n Rocket: Do you shoot tasers out of your face?\\n Taserface: It\\'s metaphorical!\\n Rocket: For what?\\n Taserface: For it is a name what strikes fear into the hearts of anyone what hears it.\\n Rocket: Okay whatever you say.\\n Taserface: You shut up. You\\'re next. Udonta, I have waited a long time to do What?\\n Rocket: I\\'m sorry. I am so sorry! I just keep imagining you waking up in the morning, sir looking in the mirror and then in all seriousness saying to yourself \"You know what would be a really kick-ass name? \"Taserface!\" Thats how I hear you in my head! What was your second choice? Scrotum Hat?\\n Taserface: New plan. We\\'re killing you first.\\n Rocket: Well, dying is certainly better than having to live an entire life as a moronic shitbag who thinks Taserface is a cool name.\\n Nebula: Thats enough killing for today.\\n Ravager: She\\'s the daughter of Thanos.\\n Taserface: I thought you were the biggest sadist in the galaxy.\\n Nebula: That was when Daddy was paying my bills. The Priestess wants to kill the fox herself. And he has bounties on his head in at least 12 Kree provinces. I assure you I am not as easy a mark as an old man without his magic stick or a talking woodland beast. I want 10% of the take and a couple more things.\\n Kraglin: We got a whole box of hands if that one dont work out.\\n Nebula: It is fine.\\n Kraglin: You think them Kree is gonna execute the captain?\\n Nebula: The Kree consider themselves merciful. It will be painless.\\n Kraglin: Well, here it is. Its the best ship we got. Location of Egos planet in the nav. Well wire you the 10% once wes paid. What are you gonna do with your share?\\n Nebula:  As a child, my father would have Gamora and me battle one another in training. Every time my sister prevailed my father would replace a piece of me with machinery claiming he wanted me to be her equal. But she won again and again, and again, never once refraining. So after I murder my sister I will buy a warship with every conceivable instrument of death. I will hunt my father like a dog, and I will tear him apart slowly piece by piece until he knows some semblance of the profound and unceasing pain I know every single day.\\n Kraglin: Yeah. I was talking about, like, a pretty necklace. Or a nice hat. Something to make the other girls go, \"Ooh, thats nice!\" Anyways, happy trails.\\n [Scene changes to Ego\\'s planet]\\n Quill: My mother told everyone my father was from the stars. She had brain cancer, so everyone thought she was delusional.\\n Ego: Peter\\n Quill: Listen, Id love to believe all of this, I really would. But you left the most wonderful woman ever to die alone.\\n Ego: I didnt want to leave your mother, Peter. If I dont return regularly to my planet and the light within it this form will wither and perish.\\n Quill: So why didnt you come back? Why did you send Yondu? A criminal, of all people, to come and fetch me?\\n Ego: I loved your mother, Peter! I couldnt stand to set foot on an Earth where she wasnt living! You cant imagine what thats like!\\n Quill: I know exactly what that feels like! I had to watch her die!\\n Ego: Over the millions and millions of years of my existence Ive made many mistakes, Peter. But youre not one of them. Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be. Theres so much that I need to teach you about this planet and the light within. They are a part of you, Peter.\\n Quill: What do you mean?\\n Ego: Give me your hands, son. Here. Hold them like that. Now, close your eyes and concentrate. Take your brain to the center of this planet. Yes!\\n Quill: Whoa!\\n Ego: Yes! Its okay. Just relax. Concentrate. You can do it. Bring it back. Yes! Yes, now shape it. Feel that energy. Yes. Youre home. Peter\\n Drax: How did you get to this weird, dumb planet?\\n Mantis: Ego found me in my larva state. Orphaned on my homeworld. He raised me by hand, and kept me as his own.\\n Drax: So youre a pet?\\n Mantis: I suppose.\\n Drax: People usually want cute pets. Why would Ego want such a hideous one?\\n Mantis: I am hideous?\\n Drax: You are horrifying to look at. Yes. But thats a good thing.\\n Mantis: Oh?\\n Drax: When youre ugly, and someone loves you you know they love you for who you are. Beautiful people never know who to trust.\\n Mantis: Well, then Im certainly grateful to be ugly.\\n Drax: Those pools, they remind me of a time when I took my daughter to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld. She was like you.\\n Mantis: Disgusting?\\n Drax: Innocent.\\n Mantis: Drax? Theres something I must tell you. [Before she can tell him, Gamora walks through the doors with a suspicious look on her face.]\\n Gamora: Whats going on?\\n Drax: This gross bug lady is my new friend.\\n Mantis: Im learning many things, like Im a pet and ugly.\\n Gamora: Youre not ugly. Drax!\\n Drax: What are you talking about?\\n Gamora: [to Mantis] Mantis can you show us where well be staying? Why are there no other beings on this planet?\\n Mantis: The planet is Ego. A dog would not invite a flea to live on his back.\\n Gamora: And youre not a flea?\\n Mantis: Im a flea with a purpose. I help him sleep.\\n Gamora: What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?\\n Mantis: Nothing. Your quarters are this way.\\n Taserface: We deliver you to the Kree in the morning. Neither one of you will last much longer after that.\\n Rocket: Okay, Taserface. Hey, tell the other guys we said \"Hi,\" Taserface!\\n (SIGHS)\\n Gef: What about this little plant? Can I smash it with a rock?\\n Taserface: No, Gef. Its too adorable to kill. Take it to the tailor.\\n Rocket: No offense, but your employees are a bunch of jerks.\\n Yondu: I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years when Stakar freed me. He offered me a place with the Ravagers. He said all I needed to do was adhere to the code. But I was young and greedy, and stupid. Like you stealing those batteries.\\n Rocket: That was mostly Drax.\\n Yondu: Me and Stakar and the other captains we werent so different from you and your friends. The only family I ever had. When I broke the code they exiled me. This is what I deserve.\\n Rocket: Slow down, drama queen. You might deserve this, but I dont. We gotta get outta here.\\n Yondu: Wheres Quill?\\n Rocket: He went off with his old man.\\n Yondu: Ego?\\n Rocket: Yeah. Its a day for dumbass names. (CHUCKLES) Youre smiling. And for a second, I got a warm feeling. But then it was ruined by those disgusting-ass teeth.\\n Yondu: You like a professional asshole or what?\\n Rocket: Pretty much a pro. Why didnt you deliver Quill to Ego like you promised?\\n Yondu: He was skinny. Could fit into places we couldnt. Good for thievin.\\n Rocket: Uh-huh.\\n Yondu: I got an idea on how to get outta here. But were gonna need your little friend.\\n ALL: (CHANTING) Mascot, mascot, mascot\\n (CHANTING CONTINUES)\\n Little fellows all worked up!\\n He needs a drink!\\n (COUGHING)\\n Look how cute it is when its all riled up.\\n Its goddang precious!\\n (ALL LAUGHING)\\n (GRUNTING)\\n (LAUGHTER CONTINUES)\\n Yondu: Psst! Hey, twig! Come here. Come on.\\n Rocket: Aw, man what did they do to you?\\n Yondu: Hey, you wanna help us get outta here? Theres something I need you to get, and bring back to me. In the captains quarters, theres a prototype fin the thing I wore on my head. Theres a drawer next to the bunk. Its in that. Its red. You got it?\\n (RAVAGERS SNORING)\\n (GROOT COMES BACK WITH UNDERWEAR)\\n Yondu: Thats my underwears.\\n Rocket: Yeah, I was pretty sure he didnt know what you were talkin about. You have to explain it more careful.\\n Yondu: Its a prototype fin.\\n (SCREECHING)\\n Rocket: Thats an orloni. Its a fin, Groot.\\n Yondu: You explain it this time.\\n Rocket: All right.\\n Yondu: Thats Vorkers eye. He takes it out when he sleeps. Go. Look again.\\n Rocket: But leave the eye here.\\n Yondu: Why?\\n Rocket: Hes gonna wake up tomorrow and hes not gonna know where his eye is! (LAUGHING)\\n Rocket: That\\'s a desk. We told you it was this big.\\n (GROOT RETURNS WITH A TOE)\\n Rocket: Tell me you guys have a refrigerator somewhere with a bunch of severed human toes. (YONDU SHAKES HIS HEAD NO) Okay. Then lets just agree to never discuss this.\\n Yondu: The drawer you wanna open has this symbol on it. Okay?\\n (GROOT HOLDS COIN OVER HEAD)\\n Yondu: What? No!\\n Rocket: He thinks you want him to wear it as a hat.\\n Yondu: Thats not what I said!\\n Groot: I am Groot.\\n Rocket: Hes relieved you dont want him to.\\n Groot: I am Groot.\\n Rocket: He hates hats.\\n Groot: I am Groot.\\n Rocket: On anyone, not just himself.\\n Groot: I am Groot.\\n Rocket: One minute you think someone has a weird-shaped head the next minute its just because you realize part of that head is the hat. Thats why you dont like hats?\\n Yondu: This is an important conversation right now?\\n (SNORING)\\n (BURPS)\\n Kraglin: That aint it. I didnt mean to do a mutiny. They killed all my friends.\\n Yondu: Get the third quadrant ready for release.\\n Rocket: One more thing. You got any clones of Quills old music on the ship?\\n (FEEDBACK)\\n (JAY & THE AMERICANS \"COME\\n A LITTLE BIT CLOSER\" PLAYING)\\n (MUSIC CONTINUES)\\n (BOTH GASP)\\n (WHISTLES)\\n (BOTH GROANING)\\n Ah.\\n (MUSIC PLAYING IN BACKGROUND)\\n (GRUNTS) Hes got it!\\n Yondus got the fin!\\n Go!\\n - (WHISTLES)\\n - (ALL GASP)\\n (RAVAGERS GROANING)\\n (WHISTLES)\\n Down there!\\n - (WHISTLES)\\n - (RAVAGERS GROANING)\\n (SCREAMING)\\n Oh!

So, by not saying it you are telling the truth, and admitting that there is.\\n Gamora: No, thats not what I\\n (SIGHS)\\n Gamora: What we should be discussing right now is something about this place. It doesnt feel right.\\n Quill: What are you talking about? Youre the one who wanted me to come here!\\n Gamora: That girl Mantis shes afraid of something.\\n Quill: Why are you trying to take this away from me?\\n Gamora: Im not trying\\n Quil: Hes my father. Hes blood.\\n Gamora: You have blood on Earth and you never wanted to return there.\\n Quill: Again, you made me come here! And Earth is the place where my mother died in front of me.\\n Gamora: No, its because that place is real, and this is a fantasy.\\n Quill: This is real! Im only half-human, remember?\\n Gamora: Thats the half Im worried about.\\n Quill: Oh, I get it. Youre jealous because Im part-god, and you like when Im the weak one.\\n Gamora: You were insufferable to begin with. I havent been able to reach Rocket.

But what I did not tell you was how, when I finally did find it it was all so disappointing. And that is when I came to a profound realization. My innate desire to seek out other life was not so that I could walk among that life. Peter I have found meaning.\\n (GASPING)\\n Quill: I see it. Eternity\\n Gamora: Oh, my God.

       "' Baba... Yes, my son. Tell me a story. (CHUCKLES) Which one? The story of home. Millions of years ago... a meteorite made of vibranium... the strongest substance in the universe... struck the continent of Africa... affecting the plant life around it. And when the time of man came... five tribes settled on it and called it Wakanda. The tribes lived in constant war with each other... until a warrior shaman... received a vision from the Panther Goddess Bast... who led him to the Heart-Shaped Herb... a plant that granted him superhuman strength, speed and instincts. The warrior became king... and the first Black Panther... the protector of Wakanda. Four tribes agreed to live under the king\\'s rule... but the Jabari Tribe isolated themselves in the mountains. The Wakandans used vibranium to develop technology... more advanced than any other nation. But as Wakanda thrived... the world around it descended further into chaos. To keep vibranium safe... the Wakandans vowed to hide in plain sight... keeping the truth of their power from the outside world. And we still hide, Baba? Yes. Why? (IN THE TRUNK BY TOO $HORT PLAYING) - Lucky shot! - That ain\\'t lucky! Whatever! Get outta here! Check up. Pick your man up! He open. Where you at? Let\\'s go, let\\'s go, let\\'s go. Pass! Pass! - Got you, E. - E, hurry up! Watch me get this. Tim Hardaway style. That\\'s what I call it, baby. Come on. What you got? You ain\\'t got nothing. Hey, look, if we get in and out quick, won\\'t be no worries. You in the van, come in through from the west. Come around the corner. - Land right here. - Mmm-hmm. Me and the twins are pulling up right here. We\\'re leaving this car behind, okay? We come this... (FAINT RUSTLING) Hide the straps. Yo, is it the Feds? No. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) It\\'s these two Grace Jones-looking chicks. They\\'re holding spears. Open it. You serious? They won\\'t knock again. (SPEAKING XHOSA) Who are you? Prince N\\'Jobu, son of Azzuri. (SPEAKING XHOSA) Prove to me you are one of us. (SPEAKS XHOSA) My King. This is James. I trust him with my life. He stays... with your permission, King T\\'Chaka. As you wish. At ease. (SPEAKS XHOSA) Come, baby brother. how you are holding up. You look strong. Glory to Bast, I am in good health. How is home? Not so good. (IN XHOSA) Baby brother. There has been an attack. This man... Ulysses Klaue... stole a quarter ton of vibranium from us... and triggered a bomb at the border to escape. Many lives were lost. He knew where we hid the vibranium... and how to strike. He had someone on the inside. Why are you here? Because I want you to look me in the eyes... and tell me why you betrayed Wakanda. I did no such thing. (SPEAKS XHOSA) Tell him who you are. Zuri, son of Badu... What? James. James, you lied to me? Leave him. You were Wakandan this whole time? You betrayed Wakanda! How could you lie to me like... Stand down. Did you think that you were the only spy we sent here? Prince N\\'Jobu... you will return home at once... where you will face the Council... and inform them of your crimes. Check up! (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Guard your man, guard your man! Yo. The tiny nation of Wakanda is mourning the death of its monarch, King T\\'Chaka. The beloved ruler was one of many confirmed dead... after a terrorist attack at the United Nations a week ago. The suspect has since been apprehended. Though it remains one of the poorest countries   in the world... fortified by mountain ranges... and an impenetrable rainforest... Wakanda does not engage in international trade or accept aid. The succession of the throne... is expected to fall to the oldest of the king\\'s two children... Prince T\\'Challa. My Prince... coming up on them now. No need, Okoye. I can handle this alone. Hmm. I will get Nakia out as quickly as possible. Just don\\'t freeze when you see her. What are you talking about? I never freeze. (MEN GRUNTING)  What\\'s going on?  It\\'s the car. It lost power. It won\\'t start. The car no start.  What happened?  The engine failed.  Ours, too. What is it, Captain? - Defense positions. - (GUNS COCKING) Defense positions.  Are we under attack? Defense positions. Get around to the side. Defense positions. Hey. Defense positions! No games. (BARKING) What do you see? (WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY) - Come in. Come in. - (SCREAMS) Over there! Look back! Watch out! (ALL SCREAMING AND GRUNTING) T\\'Challa, no! This one\\'s just a boy. He got kidnapped as well. Nakia... I... - I wanted... -  Hey! I have her! Don\\'t move! I will shoot! I will shoot her right now. (GROANS) You froze. Ah... Why are you here? You\\'ve ruined my mission. My father is dead, Nakia. I will be crowned king tomorrow. And I wish for you to be there. Carry yourselves home now. Thank you. And take the boy. Get him to his people. Thank you oh. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) You will speak nothing of this day. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. (WAKANDA BY BAABA MAAL PLAYING) Sister Nakia... My Prince... we are home. This never gets old. (WAKANDA BY BAABA MAAL  PLAYING) Queen Mother... Princess... My comfort for your loss. Thank you, Nakia. It is so good to have you back with us. Take her to the River Province to prepare her for the ceremony. Yes, General. Did he freeze? Like an antelope in headlights. (LAUGHING) Are you finished? So surprised my little sister came to see me off before our big day. You wish! I\\'m here for the EMP beads. I\\'ve developed an update. Update? No. It worked perfectly. How many times do I have to teach you? Just because something works doesn\\'t mean that it cannot be improved. You are teaching me? What do you know? More than you. I can\\'t wait to see what kind of update you make... to your ceremonial outfit. Shuri! Sorry, Mother! How are you feeling today, Mama? Proud. Your father and I would talk about this day all the time. He is with us... and it is your time to be king. Good morning. How can I help you? I was just checking out these artifacts. They tell me you\\'re the expert. Ah. You could say that. They\\'re beautiful. Where\\'s this one from? The Bobo Ashanti tribe... present day Ghana... 19th century. For real? What about this one? That one\\'s from the Edo people of Benin... 16th century. Now, tell me about this one. Also from Benin, seventh century. (CLEARS THROAT) Fula tribe, I believe. Nah. I beg your pardon? It was taken by British soldiers in Benin but it\\'s from Wakanda. And it\\'s made out of vibranium. (CHUCKLES) Don\\'t trip. I\\'mma take it off your hands for you. These items aren\\'t for sale. How do you think your ancestors got these? You think they paid a fair price? Or did they take it, like they took everything else? Sir, I\\'m going to have to (CLEARS THROAT) ask you to leave. You got  all this security in here watching me ever since I walked in. - (CLEARS THROAT) - But you ain\\'t checking for - what you put in your body. - (GASPS) All right, mate. Let\\'s have it. - Come on, mate. Time. - (GRUNTS) I think she might not be feeling too good. Somebody get some help! Come here! Call a doctor, please! Please, somebody, come help! Medical emergency right away in the West African Exhibit, please, right away. Look out. Step back, please. Step back. Thank you. Coming through over there. Medics coming through. I\\'m gonna take a break.  Let\\'s give the lady some space, please.  Step back, please, gents. Step back, please. (GUARDS GRUNT) Hey, come here. Come here. It\\'s okay. You can go, but just don\\'t tell anyone, all right? Bro, why you ain\\'t just shoot him right here? Because it\\'s better to leave the crime scene more spread out. Makes us look like amateurs. (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Now then, let\\'s see if you know what you\\'re talking about. (DEVICE WHIRRING) That\\'s just a taste. (SNIFFING) - You\\'re gonna be a rich boy. - You better sell that quick. (CHUCKLES) It\\'s already sold! Whatever you try, the Wakandans\\'ll probably show up. That\\'ll make my day. I can kill two birds with one stone. You\\'re not telling me that\\'s vibranium, too? Nah, I\\'m just feeling it. (SIREN WAILING) (UPBEAT DRUMMING) (SPEAKING XHOSA) Onward! Onward! (PEOPLE SINGING IN XHOSA) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) son of Badu... give to you... Prince T\\'Challa... the Black Panther! (ALL CHEERING) The prince... will now have the strength of the Black Panther... stripped away. (UPBEAT DRUMMING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (ALL SPEAKING XHOSA) Praise the ancestors. Praise the ancestors. Victory in ritual combat...  comes by yield or death. If any tribe wishes to put forth a warrior... I now offer... a path to the throne. - (SHOUTS) - (TRIBESPEOPLE REPEAT) The Merchant Tribe will not challenge today. - (SHOUTS) - (TRIBESPEOPLE REPEAT) The Border Tribe will not challenge today. - (SHOUTS) - (TRIBESPEOPLE REPEAT) The River Tribe will not challenge today. - (MINING TRIBESMAN SHOUTS) - (TRIBESPEOPLE REPEAT) The Mining Tribe will not challenge today. Is there any member of a royal blood... who wishes to challenge for the throne? (ALL MURMURING) This corset is really uncomfortable... so could we all just wrap it up and go home? - Mother! - (ALL EXCLAIM) (MEN CHANTING AND GRUNTING) - Are they Jabari? - Yes. (CHANTING CONTINUES) M\\'Baku, what are you doing here? It\\'s challenge day. We have watched... and listened from the mountains! We have watched with disgust... as your technological advancements have been overseen by a child! Who scoffs at tradition! And now you want to hand the nation over to this prince... who could not keep his own father safe. Mmm? We will not have it. I said, we will not have it, oh! I, M\\'Baku... leader of the Jabari... I accept your challenge, M\\'Baku. Glory to Hanuman. (UPBEAT DRUMMING) - Jabari! - (JABARI MEN YELL) Dora Milaje! (IN XHOSA) Onward! Let the challenge begin! (YELLING AND GRUNTING) Oh! (UPBEAT DRUMMING) M\\' Stand up! (YELLS) Come! - (M\\'BAKU LAUGHING) - T\\'Challa! (M\\'BAKU YELLS) Where is your god now? - (CHEERING) - Yes! (BOTH GRUNTING) No powers. No claws. No special suit, oh! Just a boy not fit to lead! Show him who you are! (T\\'CHALLA YELLS) (YELLING) (GROANS) (T\\'CHALLA GROANS) (YELLS) I am Prince T\\'Challa... son of King T\\'Chaka! You can do this, T\\'Challa!  (GRUNTS) Yes! Come on! Yield! Don\\'t make me kill you. I would rather die! (CHANTING) T\\'Challa! T\\'Challa! T\\'Challa! T\\'Challa! T\\'Challa! You have fought with honor! Now yield! Your people need you. T\\'Challa! T\\'Challa! Yield, man! T\\'Challa! T\\'Challa! (T\\'CHALLA SIGHS) - Yes! Yes! - (ALL CHEERING) I now present to you... King T\\'Challa... the Black Panther. (ALL CHEERING) Zuri. My King. (WHOOPING) Wakanda forever! Wakanda forever! Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb... to restore the powers of the Black Panther... and take you to the Ancestral Plane. (GROANS SOFTLY) T\\'Chaka... we call on you. Come here to your son. (SPEAKING XHOSA) Praise the ancestors. (SOFT GROWLING) (LAUGHING) (SPEAKS XHOSA) Father. My son. T\\' Stand up. You are a king. (SPEAKING XHOSA) What is wrong my son? I am not ready. Have you not prepared to be king your whole life? Have you not trained and studied, been by my side? what I am talking about. I am not ready to be without you. A man who has not prepared his children for his own death... has failed as a father. Have I ever failed you? Never. Tell me how to best protect Wakanda. I want to be a great king, Baba. Just like you. You\\'re going to struggle. So you\\'ll need to surround yourself with people you trust. You\\'re a good man with a good heart. And it\\'s hard for a good man to be king. (GASPING) Breathe. T\\'Challa, breathe. (BREATHING DEEPLY) Breathe. He was there. (CHUCKLES) He was there. My father. (BEREBERE BY IDRISSA SOUMAORO PLAYING) Just one? Come home, Nakia. I\\'m right here. Stay. I came to support you and to honor your father... but I can\\'t stay. I found my calling out there. I\\'ve seen too many in need just to turn a blind eye.  I can\\'t be happy here... knowing that there\\'s people out there who have nothing. What would you have Wakanda do about it? Share what we have. We could provide aid... and access to technology and refuge to those who need it. Other countries do it, we could do it better. We are not like these other countries, Nakia. If the world found out what we truly are... what we possess... we could lose our way of life. Wakanda is strong enough to help others and protect ourselves at the same time. (SIGHS) If you were not so stubborn, you would make a great queen. I would make a great queen because I am so stubborn. - Ah! See, you admit it! - If that\\'s what I wanted. T\\' Is that him? Glory to Bast, man. Is he still growing? W\\' Of course. I see Nakia is back. You guys going to work it out? T\\'Challa... what\\'s wrong? Nakia thinks we should be doing more. More, like what? Foreign aid, refugee programs. You let the refugees in... they bring their problems with them. And then Wakanda is like everywhere else. Now if you said you wanted me and my men... to go out there and clean up the world, then I\\'ll be all for it. But waging war on other countries has never been our way. (KIMOYO BEADS TRILLING) You, too, huh? Bast! We\\'re in trouble. My King. My love. You will never guess who just popped up on our radar. A misidentified Wakandan artifact... was stolen yesterday from a British museum. We have learned Ulysses Klaue... plans to sell the vibranium to an American buyer... in South Korea... tomorrow night. Klaue has escaped our pursuits for almost 30 years. Not capturing him is, perhaps, my father\\'s greatest regret. I wish to bring Klaue back here to stand trial. Wakanda does not need a warrior right now.  We need a king. My parents were killed when he attacked. Not a day goes by when I do not think about what Klaue took from us. From me. It\\'s too great an opportunity to pass. W\\' Take me with you. We\\'ll take him down together, side by side. I need you here protecting the border. Then I ask... you kill him where he stands... or you bring him back to us. You have my word. I will bring him back. We will proceed with the mission. (UPBEAT AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING) My King! - Stop it. Stop it. - (CHUCKLES) I\\'ve already sent a car ahead to Busan for you. Who are you taking with you to Korea? Okoye. And Nakia as well. You sure it\\'s a good idea to take your ex on a mission? Yes. We\\'ll be fine. Besides, you\\'ll be on call should we need backup. Yes! I have great things to show you, Brother. Here are your communication devices for Korea. Unlimited range, also equipped with audio surveillance system. Check these out. Remote access Kimoyo Beads. Updated to interface directly with my sand table. T\\' Ah. And what are these? The real question is (SHOUTS) what are those? (CHUCKLES) Why do you have your toes out in my lab? What, you don\\'t like my royal sandals? I wanted to go old school for my first day. I bet the Elders loved that. (CHUCKLES) Try them on. Fully automated. Like the old American movie Baba used to watch. T\\' Mmm. And I made them completely sound absorbent. Interesting. Guess what I call them. Sneakers. Because you... Never mind. If you\\'re going to take on Klaue... you\\'ll need the best the design group has to offer. Exhibit A. T\\' My design. Old tech. - Old? - Functional, but old. \"Hey, people are shooting at me. \"Wait, let me put on my helmet.\" - Enough.  - (CHUCKLES) Now, look at these. Do you like that one? Tempting. But the idea is to not be noticed. This one. (TRILLING) Now tell it to go on. Ooh! The entire suit sits within the teeth of the necklace. Strike it. - Anywhere? - Mmm-hmm. Not that hard, genius! You told me to strike it. You didn\\'t say how hard. I invite you to my lab, and you just kick things around? Well, maybe you should make it a little stronger. Hey. Wait a minute. The nanites absorb the kinetic energy... and hold it in place for redistribution. Very nice. Strike it again in the same spot. (KIMOYO BEADS BEEP) You\\'re recording? For research purposes. (SHURI LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) Delete that footage. (HANGOVER BY PSY AND SNOOP DOGG PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) This way. Bast willing, this will go quickly... and I can get this ridiculous thing off my head. It looks nice. Just whip it back and forth. What? It\\'s a disgrace. (IN KOREAN) Hello Sophia. Good to see you. Who are these two? My friends from Kenya. Very deep pockets. They\\'re good. Good for trouble... ...like you? (EXCLAIMS) Thank you! (PRAY FOR ME BY THE WEEKND AND KENDRICK LAMAR PLAYING) Spread out. The buyer is likely already here. The woman outside. What trouble was she referring to? Ah... I got into a disagreement with some ivory traders. - Made a bit of a mess. - Hmm. And will there be any trouble tonight, Ms. Kenyan Heiress? Depends... on how quickly we finish the mission. (ON RADIO) Can we please focus? Thank you. (SPEAKING KOREAN) Over here. One whiskey, please. Eyes up. Americans. I count three. Five. How could you miss Greased Lightning there behind you? Six. Just spotted an old friend who works for the CIA. It just got a little more complicated.  Agent Ross. Your Highness. You are buying from Klaue. What I\\'m doing or not doing... on behalf of the U.S. government is none of your concern. Now, whatever the hell you\\'re up to... do me a favor, stay out of my way. I gave you Zemo. Didn\\'t I keep it under wraps... that the king of a third world country runs around in a bulletproof cat suit? I\\'d say we were even. You really need to leave, now. Klaue is leaving out that door with me. You\\'ve been warned. Three, craps. Hey, you won! You know what? I think I\\'ll just take these... bring them over here - and hold on for safekeeping. - Mmm-hmm. Okay, heads up. The king of Wakanda is here. He cannot leave with Klaue. All right. Vibranium from the attack on Sokovia links back to a person... that I\\'m not actually saying I\\'m here to make a deal with... but that deal will not be called off. When the dust settles, you and me can work something out. I\\'m not here to make a deal. (RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO) (DOOR BUZZING AND BEEPING) Klaue, plus eight! General. In position to secure our exit. And the vibranium? I don\\'t see it yet. I thought there were no weapons allowed in here. There\\'s not supposed to be. Somebody did not get the memo. Definitely armed. Well, that is quite the entourage. You got a mixtape coming out? Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, actually, there is one. I\\'ll send you the SoundCloud link, if you like. Hey, Dave, can you get the link to the tape? Please, don\\'t make me listen to your music. I just meant you got a lot of people with you. (CHUCKLES) You think they\\'re for you? Don\\'t worry. I can do a deal with you all by myself, thank you very much. Six more. It\\'s a setup. You got the diamonds?  Okay. That\\'s enough. - We need to move on Klaue. - T\\' Stand down. We can\\'t afford a shootout. Vibranium? I was going to buy a fancy suitcase... but I thought I\\'d save myself some money. It\\'s now or never. (IN XHOSA) Stand down! Hey! (SPEAKS XHOSA) (GRUNTING) (CROWD SCREAMING) Wakandans! They\\'re here! (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Get outta here! Kill \\'em all! Diamonds, quick! (ALL GRUNTING) (YELLS) (SPEAKS XHOSA) Murderer! (GUN CLICKING) You know, you look just like your old man. (WEAPON POWERING UP) (GRUNTS) I made it rain! (LAUGHS) Let\\'s get out of here, boss! That was awesome! That was awesome! Let\\'s go! Go, go, go, come on! - Do we just leave him? - He\\'ll catch up. (DEVICE BEEPS) Shuri! Yes! Remote driving system activated. Wait! Which side of the road is it? T\\' For Bast\\'s sake! - Just drive! - Okay, calm down! Whoo! Let\\'s go! Put some music on. What do you think this is, a funeral? (UPBEAT RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) Which one is he in now? Hey, split up! - They\\'re trying to lose us. - I\\'ll take the right. We\\'ll take the other two! I see a shortcut. (TIRES SCREECH) We\\'re not going to make it! Keep going! Whoo! Brother! (BLACK PANTHER GRUNTS) Hey, what was that? Don\\'t worry about it. You\\'re doing great. Guns. So primitive! It\\'s a vibranium car, you idiots! The bullets won\\'t penetrate! What are you doing? Just drive. (MEN YELL) - Whoo! - Shit! Hey, look at your suit. You\\'ve been taking bullets, charging it up with kinetic energy. Pull around the truck. Where\\'d he go? You show-off. There he is! Hold tight! (ENGINE REVS) All right. Let\\'s have some fun! (GRUNTING) (STRAINING) (PANTING) Hop in.  Put that spear in the trunk. Faster, Shuri. I\\'m going as fast as I can! Take a right! Take a right! (TIRES SCREECH) No, no, no! (GRUNTS) Brother! (BLACK PANTHER GRUNTING) (PEOPLE EXCLAIMING) (GROANING AND PANTING) Klaue! Did you think we would forget? (BLACK PANTHER GRUNTING) Look at me, murderer! Where did you get this weapon? You savages didn\\'t deserve it. - (GRUNTS) - (GROANS) Oh, mercy, King. Mercy. Every breath you take is mercy from me. (IN XHOSA) King! The world watches. Let\\'s go, huh? (CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING) Yeah. Hello. (GIGGLES) I can see you! I can. I can see you. (CACKLING) (AIR KISSES) (SPLUTTERING) So this is a big mess, huh? I figured we could go good cop, bad cop. I\\'ll talk to him first, then you guys go in. (SPEAKING XHOSA) We can\\'t let him talk to Klaue alone. Better to let him talk to Klaue alone for 5 minutes than to make a scene here. After your questioning, we will take him back to Wakanda with us. What? No. Look, I like you, a lot. But he\\'s in my custody now. He\\'s not going anywhere. Listen, I\\'m doing you guys a favor by letting you even be in here. (SPEAKING XHOSA) If he touches you again, I\\'m going to impale him to this desk. Does she speak English? When she wants to. Huh. I\\'m going in. When I\\'m done, you guys are up. - Agent Ross. - Yeah? I do appreciate your help in Busan. You see that? It\\'s called diplomacy. You\\'re welcome. (KLAUE SINGS WHAT IS LOVE BY DEE DEE HALLIGAN AND JUNIOR TORELLO) - Okoye. - (SCOFFS) Play nice. Americans. (KLAUE CONTINUES SINGING) (ROSS CLEARS THROAT) You know, you really shouldn\\'t trust the Wakandans. I\\'m much more your speed. I don\\'t trust anybody, not in this job. But what I am interested in  is that arm cannon out there. Where\\'d you get that? It\\'s an old mining tool that I made some adjustments to. But I can get you one, if you like. Why don\\'t you give me the name of your supplier, and I\\'ll ask them. He\\'s right outside. Why don\\'t you ask him yourself? What? T\\'Challa? You\\'re telling me that weapon on your arm is from Wakanda? Bingo. What do you actually know about Wakanda? Um... Shepherds, textiles, cool outfits. (ON EARPIECE) It\\'s all a front. Explorers searched for it for centuries. El Dorado, the Golden City. They thought they could find it in South America... but it was in Africa the whole time. A technological marvel. All because it was built on a mound of the most valuable metal known to man. Isipho, they call it. The gift. Vibranium. Vibranium, yeah, strongest metal on earth. It\\'s not just a metal. They sew it into their clothes. It powers their city, their tech... their weapons. Weapons? (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Makes my arm cannon look like a leaf blower. That\\'s a nice fairy tale, but Wakanda is a third world country... and you stole all their vibranium. (LAUGHING) I stole... All of it? I took a tiny piece of it. They have a mountain full of it. They\\'ve been mining it for thousands of years... and they still haven\\'t scratched the surface. I\\'m the only outsider who\\'s seen it and got out of there alive. If you don\\'t believe me, you ask your friend what his suit is made of. What his claws are made of. (BEEPING) Your father told the UN... that Klaue stole all the vibranium you had. But now he\\'s telling me you have more. And you believe the word of an arms dealer strapped to a chair? (TRUCK BEEPING) (IN KOREAN) Where is that? Back there. How much more are you hiding?  (SPEAKING XHOSA) Something is happening out back. (YELLS) Get down! - (KLAUE YELLING) - Stand down!  Cover!  Grenade! I see you took your time, didn\\'t you? (LAUGHS) (OKOYE SPEAKING XHOSA) My King! My King. Nakia. He just jumped in front of me. (LABORED BREATHING AND GRUNTING) I don\\'t think he\\'ll make it here. It hit his spine. Give me a Kimoyo Bead. (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) This will stabilize him for now. (ROSS GRUNTING SOFTLY) (EXHALING DEEPLY) Give him to us. We can save him. Our mission was to bring back Klaue. We failed. This man is a foreign intelligence operative. How do we justify bringing him into our borders? He took a bullet for me. That was his choice. So now we are just supposed to let him die? Let us consider that we heal him. It is his duty to report back to his country. And as king, it is your duty to protect ours. I\\'m well aware of my duties, General. I cannot just let him die... knowing we can save him. Where exactly are we taking him? (UPBEAT AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING) Great! Another broken white boy for us to fix. This is going to be fun. He will live. - (KIMOYO BEADS TRILL) - (MUSIC STOPS) W\\'Kabi is here. What\\'s going on, brother? Where is Klaue? He\\'s not here. (SIGHS) He slipped through our hands. \"Slipped\"? For 30 years, your father was in power and did nothing. With you, I thought it\\'d be different. But it\\'s more of the same. Let\\'s get going, boss. You always sell to the CIA? I sell to the highest bidder. But don\\'t you worry. When I get back to Joburg... and I lay low for a bit, I\\'ll make sure both you guys get paid. Oh, I ain\\'t worried about the money, bro. I know you good for it. On our way back, just drop us off in Wakanda. You don\\'t want to  go there, boy. Yeah, I do. Drop it! Or your little Bonnie and Clyde routine ends today. Put your gun down now! I\\'m sorry. - Sorry, Erik. - It\\'s gonna be okay. (KLAUE GROANS) (GROANS) (KLAUE PANTING) You really want to go to Wakanda? They\\'re savages. This is what they do to people like us. I ain\\'t worried about no brand. Check these out. Each one is for a kill. You can scar yourself as much as you\\'d like. To them, you\\'ll just be an outsider. You\\'re crazy to think that you can walk in there. Ah, to think I saw you as some crazy American. (CHUCKLING) T\\' Leave us! So your mission did not go as planned. What happened to my uncle N\\'Jobu? My father told me he disappeared. There was a man today... wearing a ring identical to this one. That is not possible. He helped Klaue escape from us and he was wearing this ring! My grandfather\\'s ring! Do not tell me what is possible. Tell me the truth! Some truths... are too much to bear, T\\'Challa. That is not your choice to make. What happened to him? I promised the king to say nothing. I am your king now! Your uncle took... a War Dog assignment in America. Your father... placed me there... to observe... unbeknownst to him. Your uncle fell in love with an American woman. They had a child. The hardships he saw there... radicalized your uncle. I observed for as long as I could. Their leaders have been assassinated. Communities flooded with drugs and weapons. They are overly policed and incarcerated. All over the planet... our people suffer because they don\\'t have the tools to fight back. With vibranium weapons, they could overthrow every country... and Wakanda could rule them all the right way. He knew your father would not support this.  So, your uncle betrayed us. No! He helped Klaue steal the vibranium. No, no, no. You will return home at once... where you will face the Council... and inform them of your crimes. He drew his weapon on me. - No! - (GRUNTING) Your father killed his own brother... to save my life. Speak nothing of this. And the child? We left him. We had to... maintain... the lie. What is this? Just a little gift. (SPEAKING XHOSA) Who are you? (DEVICE WHIRRING) (GRUNTING) All right, where am I? Don\\'t scare me like that, colonizer! (STAMMERS) What? My name is Everett. Yes, I know. Everett Ross... former air force pilot and now CIA. Right. Okay, is this Wakanda? No, it\\'s Kansas. How long ago was Korea? Yesterday. I don\\'t think so. Bullet wounds don\\'t just magically heal overnight. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) They do here. But not by magic, by technology. Don\\'t touch anything. My brother will return soon. These train things... that\\'s magnetic levitation, right? Obviously. Obviously, but I\\'ve never seen it this efficient. The light panels, what are they? - Sonic stabilizers. - Sonic what? In its raw form... vibranium is too dangerous to be transported at that speed... so I developed a way to temporarily deactivate it. There\\'s vibranium on those trains? There\\'s vibranium all around us. That\\'s how I healed you. (CHUCKLES) Where is T\\'Challa? His Kimoyo Beads have been switched off. Well, we are not joined at the hip, Okoye. A man showed up at the border who claims to have killed Klaue. What? W\\'Kabi is transporting him, as we speak, to the palace. We need to find your brother! An outsider? No, a Wakandan. He\\'s not a Wakandan. He\\'s one of ours. He killed his own brother...  and left a child behind... with nothing. What kind of king... What kind of man does that? No man is perfect. Not even your father. He didn\\'t even give him a proper burial. My uncle N\\'Jobu betrayed us, but my father... he may have created something even worse. Hey. Look at me. You can\\'t let your father\\'s mistakes define who you are. You get to decide what kind of king you are going to be. (KIMOYO BEADS TRILL) Brother, you need to get here now! Erik Stevens. Graduated Annapolis age 19... MIT for grad school. Joined the SEALs and went straight to Afghanistan... where he wrapped up confirmed kills, like it was a video game. Started calling him Killmonger. He joined a JSOC ghost unit. Now these guys are serious. They will drop off the grid... so they can commit assassinations and take down governments. Did he reveal anything about his identity? He has a War Dog tattoo... but we have no record of him. Is this man Wakandan or not? (SPEAKING XHOSA) Tell us what is going on. Speak. I\\'m standing in your house... serving justice to a man who stole your vibranium and murdered your people. Justice your king couldn\\'t deliver. I don\\'t care that you brought Klaue. Only reason I don\\'t kill you where you stand is because I know who you are. Now, what do you want? I want the throne. (LAUGHS AND SPEAKS XHOSA) My goodness. (TRIBES\\' ELDERS LAUGHING) Y\\'all sittin\\' up here comfortable. Must feel good. It\\'s about two billion people all over the world that looks like us. But their lives are a lot harder. Wakanda has the tools to liberate \\'em all. And what tools are those? Vibranium. Your weapons. Our weapons will not be used to wage war on the world. It is not our way to be judge, jury and executioner...  for people who are not our own. Not your own? But didn\\'t life start right here on this continent? So ain\\'t all people your people? I am not king of all people. I am king of Wakanda. And it is my responsibility to make sure our people are safe... and that vibranium does not fall into the hands of a person like you. Mmm... Son. We have entertained this charlatan for too long. Reject his request. Oh, I ain\\'t requesting nothing. - Ask who I am. - You\\'re Erik Stevens. An American black operative. A mercenary nicknamed Killmonger. That\\'s who you are. That\\'s not my name, Princess. Ask me, King. No. Ask me. Take him away. (IN XHOSA) Who are you? I am N\\'Jadaka, son of Prince N\\'Jobu. Son of N\\'Jobu? with Panther claws in his chest! You ain\\'t the son of a king. You a son of a murderer. (IN XHOSA) You\\'re lying! - I\\'m afraid not, Queen Mother. (GASPS) What? (SPEAKING XHOSA) The descendent of N\\'Jobu. I\\'m exercising my blood right to challenge for the mantles of king... and Black Panther. Do not do this, T\\'Challa. As the son of Prince N\\'Jobu, he is within his rights. He has no rights here! The challenge will take weeks to prepare. Weeks? I don\\'t need weeks. The whole country ain\\'t gotta be there. I just need him. And somebody to get me outta these chains. T\\'Challa, what do you know of this? I accept your challenge. He\\'ll never beat T\\'Challa. He should\\'ve just come to the first challenge and gotten it over with. (UPBEAT DRUMMING) The king will now have the strength of the Black Panther stripped away. (LABORED BREATHING) Where is Agent Ross? I locked him in the office. He\\'s not going anywhere. This is your last chance. Throw down your weapons,  and we can handle this another way. I lived my entire life waitin\\' for this moment. I trained, I lied, I killed... just to get here. I killed in America, Afghanistan... Iraq. I took life from my own brothers and sisters right here on this continent. And all this death... just so I could kill you. Let the challenge begin. - (FAST-TEMPO DRUMMING) - (GRUNTING) Yield! (GROANS) (T\\'CHALLA GRUNTS) (GROANS) Snap out of it, T\\'Challa! (GRUNTING AND GROANING) (YELLS) (GASPS) (BREATHES HEAVILY) (GRUNTS) (GROANING) Come on, get up. Come here. This is for my father. Erik! - Zuri, no. - Stop! - Zuri! - Zuri, don\\'t! I am the cause of your father\\'s death. Not him. Take me. I\\'ll take you both, Uncle James. No! No! No! Zuri, no! (GROANS) No! No! No! Zuri! Zuri! No! No! (YELLING) Is this your king? Huh? (T\\'CHALLA GRUNTING) Is this your king? The Black Panther, who\\'s supposed to lead you into the future? Come on, Brother! Is there nothing that can be done? - (T\\'CHALLA GRUNTING) - Him? He\\'s supposed to protect you? - No. - No! No! Nah. I\\'m your king. - No! No! - We have to go now! Queen Mother, let\\'s go! (RAMONDA CRYING) The Queen Mother and Shuri, they are safe? - Yes. - (SIGHS) (IN XHOSA) Thank you. to them immediately. (IN XHOSA) I cannot. Though my heart is with you. We cannot turn over our nation to a man who showed up here only hours ago. He is of royal blood. - He killed T\\'Challa! - In ritual combat. Does that really matter? You are the greatest warrior Wakanda has. Help me overthrow him before he becomes too strong. Overthrow? Nakia! I\\'m not a spy who can come and go as they so choose! I am loyal to that throne, no matter who sits upon it. What are you loyal to? I loved him.  I loved my country, too. Then you serve your country. No. I save my country. What\\'s wrong? The king is dead. Come with me, unless you want to join him. First Baba. And now my brother. (CRYING) Mama, we didn\\'t even get to bury him. (RAMONDA SIGHS) - (WHISPERS) It\\'s me. - Nakia. Who is this man? He\\'s a friend of T\\'Challa\\'s. He saved my life. Where\\'s Okoye? Okoye is not coming. She and the Dora Milaje will serve the new king. Wait here. What has happened to our Wakanda? (CHANTING SOFTLY) Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb... to give you the powers of the Black Panther... and take you to the Ancestral Plane. (SOBBING QUIETLY) N\\' What did I tell you about going into my things? Hmm? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) What did you find? Your home. I gave you a key hoping that you might see it someday. Yes. The sunsets there are the most beautiful in the world. But I fear you still may not be welcome. Why? They will say you are lost. But I\\'m right here. (SIGHS HEAVILY) No tears for me? Everybody dies. It\\'s just life around here. Well, look at what I have done. I should\\'ve taken you back long ago. Instead, we are both abandoned here. Well, maybe your home is the one that\\'s lost. That\\'s why they can\\'t find us. (GASPING) Breathe! Breathe, My King, breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. The Heart-Shaped Herb did that? This all of it? Yes. So when it comes time for another king, we will be ready. Another king? Yeah, go ahead and burn all that. My King, we cannot do that. It is our tradition... (CHOKING) When I tell you to do something, I mean that shit. (YELPS) (BOTH GASP) Burn it all! (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) You know, where I\\'m from... when black folks started revolutions, they never had the firepower...  or the resources to fight their oppressors. Where was Wakanda? Hmm? Yeah, all that ends today. We got spies embedded in every nation on Earth. Already in place. I know how colonizers think. So we\\'re gonna use their own strategy against \\'em. We\\'re gonna send vibranium weapons out to our War Dogs. They\\'ll arm oppressed people all over the world... so they can finally rise up and kill those in power. And their children. And anyone else who takes their side. It\\'s time they know the truth about us! We\\'re warriors! The world\\'s gonna start over, and this time, we\\'re on top. The sun will never set on the Wakandan empire. Wakanda has survived for so long... by fighting when only absolutely necessary. Wakanda survived in the past this way, yes. But the world is changing, General. Elders, it is getting smaller. The outside world is catching up... and soon it will be the conquerors or the conquered. I\\'d rather be the former. You heard your orders. Let\\'s get to it. So where are we going again? We\\'re taking the Heart-Shaped Herb to Jabariland. Heart-Shaped Herb? What is that? It gives whoever takes it heightened abilities. It\\'s what made T\\'Challa so strong. Nakia. I don\\'t like this. The Herb belongs to us. We may be creating a bigger monster with M\\'Baku. Nakia, you should take it yourself. I am a spy with no army. I wouldn\\'t stand a chance. (SIGHS) We\\'ll go. Oh, boy. (SHUSHES) (MEN CHANTING AND GRUNTING) Oh, shit. Look down. Stay calm. Shuri. Look down. My son... was murdered in ritual combat. - Were the odds fair? - Yes, but... So it was less a murder than a defeat. - Do not rub our noses in it! - Silence! I make the pronouncements here, girl. Look, uh, Your Highness,  the new king is a U.S... (GRUNTS) - The new king... - (MEN GRUNTING) M\\' You cannot talk! One more word, and I will feed you to my children. I\\'m kidding. We are vegetarians. (LAUGHING) Great Gorilla M\\'Baku... this is why we are here. To offer this to you. An outsider sits on our throne. Only you can help us stop him. Come with me. - (GASPS) - Impossible! (RAMONDA GASPING) Is he breathing? He\\'s in a coma. Barely clinging to life. One of our fishermen found him at the edge of the river border. He brought him to me. Why do you have him in the snow? It is the only thing keeping him from joining the ancestors. We need to get him to my lab. I can heal him there. Take him. He\\'ll be dead in seconds. Nakia, the Herb. I call upon the ancestors. I call upon Bast. I am here with my son, T\\'Challa. Heal him. We must bury him. Cover him. Cover him! Okay. (IN XHOSA) Praise the ancestors. Praise the ancestors. Praise the ancestors. Praise the ancestors. Wake up, T\\'Challa. Wake up. (T\\'CHAKA SPEAKS XHOSA) My son. for you to come home... and be reunited with me. (SPEAKS XHOSA) Why? bring the boy home? Why, Baba? He... He was the truth I chose to omit. You were wrong to abandon him. I chose my people. I chose Wakanda. Our future depended... You were wrong! All of you were wrong! To turn your backs on the rest of the world! We let the fear of our discovery stop us from doing what is right! No more! I cannot stay here with you. I cannot rest while he sits on the throne. He is a monster of our own making. I must take the mantle back. I must! I must right these wrongs. - (T\\'CHALLA GASPS) - (RAMONDA EXCLAIMING) (SHIVERING) Do you have a blanket? Killmonger has the full support of our military.  And he burned the garden of the Heart-Shaped Herb. Of course he did. That\\'s what he was trained to do. His unit used to work with the CIA to destabilize foreign countries. They would always strike at transitions of power... like an election year, or the death of a monarch. You get control of government, the military... - Our resources. - Right. The Great Mound. Our vibranium, all of my designs. He will send our weapons all over the world. You must get them out of Wakanda safely. - What? - What about you? The challenge will have to continue. T\\'Challa, we will not leave Wakanda. It is my duty to keep you safe. If he gets control of our technology, nowhere will be safe. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) The Black Panther lives. And when he fights for the fate of Wakanda... I will be right there beside him. As will I. I\\'m in, too. What? You\\'re gonna need all the help you can get. (M\\'BAKU YAWNS LOUDLY) Are you done? (STAMMERS) Are you done? Could you give me and Lord M\\'Baku a moment? (SIGHS) Thank you. I owed you a great debt. A life for a life. Consider it paid. Please allow my mother to stay here. No harm will come to her. I give you my word. You know, I could use an army as well. I bet you could. (LAUGHS) But no. I will give no Jabari lives towards your cause. It is our cause. - It is for all of us. - Oh, us? Us? You are the first king to come here in centuries... and now you speak of \"us\"? I cannot speak for past kings. But an enemy sits on the throne right now. We both know the power of vibranium. If Killmonger gains control of it, who do you think he will come for next? We will not help you. (SIGHS) (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) W\\' Everything is on schedule. Have the spies been alerted?  Yes. Some resistance to our new mission. But the War Dogs in London, New York and Hong Kong are standing by. We\\'ll strike there first. The others\\'ll come around. Look at this. A handheld sonic cannon, powerful enough to stop a tank... untraceable by metal detectors. And we got thousands of them. The world\\'s gonna find out exactly who we are. (EXPLOSION) He lives. N\\'Jadaka! Wassup? I never yielded! And as you can see, I am not dead! All that challenge shit is over with! I\\'m the king now! Get those planes in the air! Carry out the mission! - Shuri, now. - (ON RADIO) Copy that. Go, go, go! Come on, Ross! W\\'Kabi, man, kill this clown. W\\'Kabi, the challenge is not complete. What will we do? Border Tribe! (ALL GRUNTING) (SHOUTS IN XHOSA) (ALL YELLING) Your heart is so full of hatred... you are not fit to be a king! Come on! Ayo, the king! (SHOUTS IN XHOSA) (ALL GRUNTING) (SHOUTS IN XHOSA) Shields! (GRUNTING) (ALL YELLING) Ah! W\\'Kabi, stop this! Stop this now! No! (BLOWING HORN) (MEN CHANTING) (ALL GRUNTING) Nakia and I will get control of the Royal Talon with this. So what do I do? You\\'ll have to fly it. - What? - You were a great pilot. Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll guide you through it. It\\'s just like riding a hoverbike. What? You guys have hoverbikes? Hey, Nakia, take that. - I\\'m not a Dora. - Just put it on, it\\'s armor! Come! Good luck, Agent Ross! Yeah, I don\\'t know what I\\'m doing with this. We\\'re counting on you. (ALL GRUNTING) (SPEAKS XHOSA) (ALL GRUNT) (KILLMONGER GRUNTS) (SCREAMING) Come on! (ALL YELLING AND GRUNTING) Go, go! Remote piloting system activated. My God. I made it American style for you. Get in. All right. (GRUNTS)  Yes! Go! We can\\'t let those weapons get beyond Wakanda. All right, I\\'m on it. (BLACK PANTHER GRUNTING) (SPEAKS XHOSA) Lock! (KILLMONGER GROANING) Get him down! Get the necklace! Get the necklace! (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) Okay, Shuri. I got \\'em. What do I do? Shoot them down, genius! All right. Here goes nothing. All right, got them. Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (YELLING) - Nice! - (SCREAMS) (STRAINING) (KILLMONGER GROANING) (WEAPON POWERS DOWN) (PANTING) (ALL YELLING) (ALL GRUNTING) Shuri! (YELLS) What\\'s up, Princess? You\\'ll never be a true king. (BLACK PANTHER GRUNTS) Brother! (BOTH GRUNTING) (GROANS) Shuri. Brother! Turn on the train on the bottom track. The stabilizers will deactivate your suit! You won\\'t have protection! Neither will he. Okay! (BEEPS) I don\\'t need a suit to kill you. Your reign is over! You sat up here, safe and protected. T\\' You want to see us become just like the people you hate so much. Divide and conquer the land as they did! Nah, I learn from my enemies. Beat them at they own game. You have become them! You will destroy the world, Wakanda included! The world took everything away from me! Everything I ever loved! But I\\'mma make sure we\\'re even. I\\'mma track down anyone who would even think about being loyal to you! And I\\'m gonna put they ass in the dirt right next to Zuri! (YELLS) - Nakia! - (NAKIA GRUNTING) - Are you all right? - I\\'m okay. You? - Yes. - Let\\'s go. Shuri, I\\'ve lost one of them, but two are on my tail. (MUFFLED EXPLOSION) Shit. What the hell was that? The lab is under attack. What? Where? Deactivating hologram. Ross, you have to get out of there, now! How long have I got? Glass integrity is at 50%. Put me back in. Ross! Ross! (ALL GRUNTING) Surrender now! You have three seconds to lay down your weapon! One! Two! (MEN GRUNTING) Witness the might of the Jabari firsthand! (YELLING) (YELLS) (SHOUTS IN XHOSA) (SHOUTS IN XHOSA) (BOTH GRUNTING) (GROANING) (BOTH GRUNTING) Glass integrity is at 15%. - Critical weapons failure. - Shit! Hey, Shuri! The last cargo ship is almost at the border... but they got me trapped with some kind of cables. Make an X with your arms! Sonic Overload initiated. Now break it! System rebooting in five... four, three... two, one. System rebooted. Yes! We did it! Great! Now get out of there! (ALL GRUNTING) (SPEAKS XHOSA) Charge! (GRUNTS) (YELLS) (W\\'KABI GRUNTS) Drop your weapon! Would you kill me, my love? For Wakanda? Without question! (SPIRITUAL AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING) (BOTH GRUNTING) This is it for you, Cousin. (GROANING) Hell of a move! (BREATHES HEAVILY) My pop said Wakanda was the most beautiful thing he ever seen. (KILLMONGER GROANS) He promised he was gonna show it to me one day. You believe that? Kid from Oakland, running around believing in fairy tales. (GROANING) (SIGHS) It\\'s beautiful. (LABORED BREATHING) Maybe we can still heal you. Why? So you can just lock me up? Nah. Just bury me in the ocean... with my ancestors that jumped from the ships. \\'Cause they knew death was better than bondage. (GRUNTS) (SIGHS) (WAKANDA BY BAABA MAAL PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Thank you. You saved me. You saved my family. Our nation. There\\'s nothing to thank me for. It is our duty to... It was my duty to fight for what I love. I should\\'ve...  You can\\'t blame me, I almost died. Stay. I think I know a way you can still fulfill your calling. Please stay. (SLEEP WALKIN BY MOZZY PLAYING)  Oh, he moves it! He moves it!  Who man is that?  Bucket!  Easy. When you said you would take me to California for the first time... I thought you meant Coachella... or Disneyland. Why here? This is where our father killed our uncle. They\\'re tearing it down. Good. They are not tearing it down. I bought this building. And that building. And that one over there. This will be the first Wakandan International Outreach Center. Nakia will oversee the social outreach. And you will spearhead the science and information exchange. (CHUCKLES) You\\'re kidding. Eh? (KIMOYO BEADS TRILL) Oh... Hey, yo. Man, what the hell is that?  That\\'s like a Bugatti spaceship! Bro, it came out of nowhere. Did y\\'all see that? What?  Check it out, bro. We can take this back to the house. Pull up to school in this. Look, we can break it apart. We can sell it.  On eBay.  Everybody get, like, a million apiece. I wouldn\\'t do that if I were you guys.  Where you come from? From Wakanda.  What is a Wakanda?  Hey, yo! This yours? Who... Who are you? (ALL THE STARS BY KENDRICK LAMAR AND SZA PLAYING) (CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING) My name is King T\\'Challa... son of King T\\'Chaka. I am the sovereign ruler of the nation of Wakanda. And for the first time in our history... we will be sharing our knowledge and resources... with the outside world. Wakanda will no longer watch from the shadows. We cannot. We must not. We will work to be an example of how we... as brothers and sisters on this earth... should treat each other.  Now, more than ever... the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth. More connects us than separates us. But in times of crisis... the wise build bridges... while the foolish build barriers. We must find a way... to look after one another... as if we were one, single tribe. With all due respect, King T\\'Challa... what can a nation of farmers have to offer the rest of the world? (ALL MURMURING) (RUSTLES) (BOYS GIGGLING) Are you playing around with that man again? - No. - You\\'re teasing him again. - Don\\'t wake him. He must rest. - No, I\\'m not. No, I\\'m not. Thabo, you\\'re doing that.  He\\'s doing it. He\\'s lying. No, he\\'s resting. Go, go! (IN XHOSA) White Wolf! (IN XHOSA) White Wolf! Good morning, Sergeant Barnes. Bucky. How are you feeling? Good. Thank you. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Come. Much more for you to learn. '"

       "' Now I know what youre thinking  Oh no Thors in a cage How did this happen  Well sometimes you have to get captured  just to get a straight answer out of somebody  Its a long story  but basically Im a bit of a hero  See I spent some time on Earth  fought some robots  saved the planet a couple of times  Then I went searching through the cosmos  for some magic colourful Infinity Stone things  Didnt find any  Thats when I came across  a path of death and destruction  which led me all the way here into this cage  where I met you  Hmm  How much longer do you think well be here        Thor son of Odin  Surtur son of a bitch  Youre still alive  I thought my father killed you a half a million years ago  I cannot die  Not until I fulfil my destiny  and lay waste to your home  Its funny you should mention that  Because Ive been having these terrible dreams of late  Asgard up in flames falling to ruins  And you Surtur  are at the centre of all of them  Then you have seen Ragnarok the fall of Asgard   The great prophecy  Hang on   Hang on   Ill be back around shortly  I really feel like we were connecting there    Okay so Ragnarok  Tell me about that Walk me through it  My time has come  When my crown is reunited with the Eternal Flame  I shall be restored to my full might  I will tower over the mountains  and bury my sword deep in Asgards Oh hang on Give it a second  I swear Im not even moving  Its just doing this on its own   Im really sorry   Okay so let me get this straight  Youre going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame  and then youll suddenly grow as big as a house  A mountain  The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard  Odin is not on Asgard  And your absence has left the throne defenseless  Okay so where is it This crown  This is my crown the source of my power  Oh thats a crown  I thought it was a big eyebrow  Its a crown  Anyway it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok  is rip that thing off your head   But Ragnarok has already begun  You cannot stop it    I am Asgards doom and so are you  All will suffer all will burn  Oh thats intense  To be honest seeing you grow really big  and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle  But it looks like Im gonna have to choose option B  where I bust out of these chains  knock that tiara off your head  and stash it away in Asgards vault  You cannot stop Ragnarok  Why fight it  Because thats what heroes do   Hmm  Wait Im sorry I didnt time that right    Hmm  And now      You have made a grave mistake Odinson  I make grave mistakes all the time    Everything seems to work out                  Huh    Heimdall I know its been a while  but I could really use a fast exit  Heimdall Heimdall was an idiot  This job should have made him rich  Now the job aint easy  but it does have its benefits  The Bifrost gives me access to everything  the Nine Realms has to offer  I mean its all mine for the taking  Behold  my stuff  Ooh  Im particularly fond of these  I pulled them out of a place on Midgard called Texas  I even named them Des and Troy  You see when you put them together  they destroy    Heimdall come on      Stay  Heimdall Im running short on options   Heimdall   Um Skurge    Is that important You girls are in for a treat              Girls  Well well well Look who decided to pop in  Thanks for scaring away my company  and drenching my workplace in brains  Who are you  Dont you remember Im Skurge  We fought together on Vanaheim  Right Where is Heimdall  That traitor No one knows Hes a fugitive of the throne  Traitor  Yeah Well you see Odin charged Heimdall  with negligence of duty  but he disappeared before the trial  Hard to catch a guy  who can see everything in the universe  Sure  Hold on Im supposed to announce your arrival        What the hell is that     Oh brother This is it  I take my leave   You fool you didnt listen   Im sorry  Lady Sif get help  Somebody help   Sorry for all Ive done  Shh Its all right Hold on  Im sorry I tried to rule Earth  Theyd be lucky to have you  Im sorry about that thing with the Tesseract   I just couldnt help myself  I know  Im a trickster  So mischievous  Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog  It was a wonderful joke  Twas indeed hilarious    You are the saviour of Asgard   Tell my story  I will  Build a statue for me  We will build a big statue for you  With my helmet on with the big bendy horns  I will tell Father what you did here today  I didnt do it for him  I didnt do it for him      No    And so Loki died of his wounds  giving his life for ours  He fought back those disgusting elves  he brought peace to the realm  Loki my boy  twas many moons ago I found you  on that frostbitten battlefield  On that day I did not yet see in you  Asgards saviour No  You were merely a little blue baby icicle  that melted this old fools heart    Bravo Bravo Well done Bravo  Father  Oh shit  Uh my son Thor has returned   Greetings my boy   Its an interesting play Whats it called  The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard  The people wanted to commemorate him Ah indeed they should  I like the statue  A lot better looking than he was when he was alive though  A little less weasely less greasy maybe  Do you know what this is  The skull of Surtur Thats a formidable weapon  Do me a favour Lock this away in a vault  so it doesnt turn into a giant monster  and destroy the whole planet  Thank you dear Um  So its back to Midgard for you is it  Nope  Ive been having this reoccurring dream lately  Every night I see Asgard fall into ruins Thats just a silly dream  signs of an overactive imagination Possibly  But then I decide to go out there and investigate  And what do I find  but the Nine Realms completely in chaos  Enemies of Asgard assembling plotting our demise  all while you Odin  the protector of those Nine Realms  are sitting here in your bathrobe  eating grapes  Yes it is best to respect our neighbours freedom  Yes of course the freedom to be massacred  Yes besides Ive been rather busy myself  Watching theatre  Board meetings and security council meetings  Youre really gonna make me do it  Do what    You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir  as it returns to my hand  Not even your face  Youve gone quite mad Youll be executed for this  Then Ill see you on the other side brother  All right I yield    Behold  Thor   Odinson  No  You had one job Just the one  Wheres Odin  You just couldnt stay away could you  Everything was fine without you  Asgard was prospering Youve ruined everything   Ask them  Wheres Father   Did you kill him  You had what you wanted  You had the independence you asked for   Whoa whoa whoa  Okay I know exactly where he is    I swear I left him right here Right here on the sidewalk  or right there where the building is being demolished  Great planning  How was I supposed to know  Cant see into the future Im not a witch  No Then why do you dress like one   Hey  I cant believe youre alive  I saw you die  I mourned you I cried for you  Im honoured Ask him  Hi Would you mind taking a picture with us   Oh sure   Start figuring out where he is    Oh my God  Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you  She didnt dump me you know  I dumped her It was a mutual dumping  Whats this What are you doing  This isnt me    Loki      Thor Odinson  God of Thunder  You can put down the umbrella    So Earth has uh wizards now  {CHUCKUNG   The preferred term is  Master of the Mystic Arts You can leave that now  All right wizard  Who are you Why should I care  My name is Doctor Stephen Strange  and I have some questions for you  Take a seat  Tea  I dont drink tea  What do you drink  Not tea  So I keep a watch list  of individuals and beings from other realms  that may be a threat to this world  Your adopted brother Loki is one of those beings  Hes a worthy inclusion Hmm  Then why bring him here  Were looking for my father  So if I were to tell you where Odin was  all parties concerned would promptly return to Asgard  Promptly  Great Then Ill help you  If you knew where he was why didnt you call me  I have to tell you he was adamant  that he not be disturbed  Your father said he had chosen to remain in exile   Hmm  And you dont have a phone  No I dont have a phone  but you could have sent an electronic letter  Its called an email   Yeah do you have a computer  No What for   Uhhuh  Anyway  my father is no longer in exile  So if you could tell me where he is  I can take him home  Gladly Hes in Norway  Im just seeing whether this incantation  requires any Asgardian modifications  Nope  Oh we dont need that    Will you stop doing that    I need just one strand of your hair  Let me explain something  My hair is not to be meddled with   We could have just walked  Hes waiting for you  All right  Dont forget your umbrella  Oh yes      Sorry  There we go  I suppose Ill need my brother back  Oh yeah Right      I have been falling for  minutes  You can handle him from here  Yes Of course  Thank you very much for your help  Good luck  Handle me Who are you  Loki You think youre some kind of sorcerer  Dont think for one minute you secondrate  Byebye        Father  Look at this place Its beautiful  Father its us  My sons  Ive been waiting for you  I know Weve come to take you home  Home yes  Your mother she calls me  Do you hear it  Loki lift your magic    Took me quite a while to break free from your spell  Frigga would have been proud  Come and sit with me I dont have much time    I know that we failed you  But we can make this right  I failed you  It is upon us Ragnarok  No Ive stopped Ragnarok I put an end to Surtur  No  It has already begun Shes coming  My life was all that held her back  But my time has come  I cannot keep her away any longer  Father who are you talking about  Goddess of Death Hela  My firstborn  Your sister  Your what  Her violent appetites grew beyond my control  I couldnt stop her so I imprisoned her  Locked her away  She draws her strength from Asgard  and once she gets there her powers will be limitless  Whatever she is we can stop her together  We can face her together  No we wont  Im on a different path now  This you must face alone  I love you my sons  Look at that  Remember this place  Home          Brother      This was your doing      So hes gone  Thats a shame I wouldve liked to have seen that  You must be Hela  Im Thor son of Odin  Really You dont look like him  Perhaps we can come to an arrangement  You sound like him  Kneel  Beg your pardon  Kneel  Before your queen  I dont think so      Its not possible  Darling you have no idea whats possible      Bring us back  No  Loki      Who are you What have you done with Thor      Im Hela  Im just a janitor  You look like a smart boy with good survival instincts  How would you like a job              Are you a fighter  Or are you food  Im just passing through  It is food  On your knees               Hes mine  Wait    Wait  Hes mine  So if you want him you go through me  But weve already got him  All right then I guess I go through you    More food                  Thank you      Scrapper  I need clearance and an audience with the boss  Ive got something special  Hey Where are you taking me  Answer me  Hey  I am Thor son of Odin I need to get back to Asgard   Many apologies your majesty     Its come to my attention that you dont know who I am  I am Hela Odins firstborn  the commander of the Legions of Asgard  the rightful heir to the throne  and the Goddess of Death  My father is dead  As are the princes Youre welcome  We were once the seat  of absolute power in the cosmos  Our supremacy was unchallenged  Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms  Our destiny is to rule over all others  And I am here to restore that power  Kneel before me  and rise into the ranks of my great conquest  Whoever you are  whatever youve done surrender now  Or we will show you no mercy  Whoever I am  Did you listen to a word I said  This is your last warning  I thought youd be happy to see me    Fine   Charge              Oh Ive missed this  Still its a shame  Good soldiers dying for nothing  all because they couldnt see the future  Sad    Oh look still

Grandmaster  I preside over a little harlequinade  called the Contest of Champions  People come from far and wide  to unwillingly participate in it  And you my friend  might just be part of the new cast  What do you say to that  Were not friends and I dont give a shit about your games  Im going back to Asgard   Assgard   One two three four There was a wormhole in space and time beneath me  At that moment I let go   Loki  Loki Loki   Over here Over here    Excuse me one second  Loki      What  Youre alive   Yes of course Im alive  What are you doing here  What do you mean what am I doing  Im stuck in this stupid chair   Wheres your chair  I didnt get a chair   Get me out of this one  I cant   Get me out What  I cant  Ive made friends with this man  Hes called the Grandmaster   Oh hes crazy  Ive gained his favour  The Bifrost brought me out here weeks ago   Weeks ago  Yes  I just got here   What are you whispering about    Time works real different around these parts  On any other world Id be like millions of years old  But here on Sakaar    In any case you know this uh  You call yourself Lord of Thunder  God of Thunder Tell him  Ive never met this man in my life   Hes my brother  Adopted  Is he any kind of a fighter   You take this thing  out of my neck and Ill show you  Now listen to that Hes threatening me  Hey Sparkles heres the deal  If you wanna get back to Assplace Assberg  Asgard  Any contender who defeats my champion  their freedom they shall win  Fine Then point me in the direction  of whoevers ass I have to kick  Thats what I call contender  Direction would be this way Lord  Ah Loki    Hey hey hey Take it easy man    Over here  The pile of rocks waving at you Here  Yeah Im actually a thing Im a being  Allow me to introduce myself My name is Korg  Im kind of like the leader in here  Im made of rocks as you can see  But dont let that intimidate you  You dont need to be afraid  unless youre made of scissors   Just a little rockpaperscissor  joke for you  This is my very good friend over here Miek  Hes an insect and has knives for hands  Youre a Kronan arent you   That I am  Howd you end up in here  Ah well I tried to start a revolution  but didnt print enough pamphlets  So hardly anyone turned up  except for my mum and her boyfriend who I hate  As punishment I was forced  to be in here and become a gladiator  Bit of a promotional disaster that one  But Im actually organising another revolution  I dont know if youd be interested  in something like that  Do you reckon youd be interested  How did you  Ah yeah no This whole thing is a circle  But not a real circle more like a freaky circle  This doesnt make any sense  No nothing makes sense here man  The only thing that does make sense  is that nothing makes sense  Has anyone here fought the Grandmasters champion  Doug has  Doug  Our luck Dougs dead  Thats right  Everyone who fights  the Grandmasters champion perishes  What about you Youre made of rocks  Perishable rock There you go Another one gone  Yeah no I just do the smaller fights  warm up the crowd and whatnot  Wait Youre not gonna face him are you  Yes I am  Gonna fight him win  and get the hell out of this place  Thats exactly what Doug used to say  See you later new Doug  Does no one remember me  Has no one been taught our history  Look at these lies  Goblets and garden parties  Peace treaties  Odin  proud to have it  ashamed of how he got it    We were unstoppable  I was his weapon in the conquest  that built Asgards empire  One by one the realms became ours  But then simply because my ambition outgrew his  he banished me caged me locked me away like an animal  Before that Asgards warriors were honoured  their bodies buried as heroes beneath this very palace   Odins treasures  Fake    Most of the stuff in here is fake  Or weak  Smaller than I thought it would be  Thats not bad   But this  The Eternal Flame    Want to see what true power really looks like    Fenris my darling what have they done to you  With the Eternal Flame you are reborn    Ive missed you  Ive missed you all Odin  I bid you take your place in the halls of Valhalla  where the brave shall live forever  Nor shall we mourn but rejoice  for those that have died the glorious death  Hurts doesnt it  Being lied to  Being told youre one thing  and then learning its all a fiction  You didnt think Id really come and see you did you  This place is disgusting    Does this mean you dont want my help  Look I couldnt jeopardise my position with the Grandmaster  It took me time to win his trust  Hes a lunatic but he can be amenable  What Im telling you is  you could join me at the Grandmasters side  Perhaps in time  an accident befalls the Grandmaster and then      Youre not seriously thinking of going back are you  Our sister destroyed your hammer  like a piece of glass  Shes stronger than both of us Shes stronger than you  You dont stand a chance  Do you understand what Im saying to you    Fine  I guess Ill just have to go it alone  Like Ive always done  Would you say something  Say something  What would you like me to say  You faked your own death  you stole the throne stripped Odin of his power  stranded him on Earth to die  releasing the Goddess of Death  Have I said enough or would you like me to go back  further than the past two days  You know I havent seen this  beloved champion he talks of  but Ive heard he is astonishingly savage  Ive placed a large wager against you tomorrow  Dont let me down   Piss off ghost  Hes freaking gone   Oh yuck  Theres still someones hair and blood all over this  Guys can you clean up the weapons  once you finish your fight  Disgusting slobs  Oh Thor  wanna use a big wooden fork  No  Yeah not really useful  Unless youre fighting off three vampires  that were huddled together  I really wish I had my hammer  Hammer  Quite unique It was made from this  special metal from the heart of a dying star  And when I spun it really really fast  it gave me the ability to fly  You rode a hammer  No I didnt ride the hammer  The hammer rode you on your back  No I used to spin it really fast  and it would pull me off the  Oh my God A hammer pulled you off  The ground It would pull me off the ground  up into the air and I would fly  Every time I threw it  it would always come back to me  Sounds like you had a pretty special  and intimate relationship with this hammer  and that losing it  was almost comparable to losing a loved one  Thats a nice way of putting it  I said theyre mine  See her thats the one that put me in here  Oh yeah Scrapper   Gotta watch out for those Asgardians man  They are hard to perish  Asgardian  Hey HEY  Hey  Do not zap me with that thing I just wanna talk  Asgard is in danger  My God youre a Valkyrie  I used to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was younger  until I found out that you were all women  Theres nothing wrong with women of course  I love women  Sometimes a little too much  Not in a creepy way  just more of a respectful appreciation  I think its great that there is  an elite force of women warriors  Its about time  Are you done Lord of Thunder youre up  Please help me I need your help  Bye  Fine then you must be a traitor or a coward  Because the Valkyrie is sworn to protect the throne  Listen closely your majesty This is Sakaar not Asgard  And Im a Scrapper not a Valkyrie     Bring him in for processing  And no one escapes this place So youre gonna die anyway Now dont you move  My hands aint as steady as they used to be  By Odins beard you shall not cut my hair  lest you feel the wrath of the mighty Thor    Please Please kind sir do not cut my hair    Please No  No    Wow Look at all of you   What a show What a night  Whos having fun  Please Im your

escape her banishment  he sent the Valkyrie in to fight her back  I only survived because  Look I already faced her once  back when I believed in the throne  and it cost me everything  Thats whats

Where was I  My precious champion has come up missing  and its all because of that Lord of Thunder  Its all because of him Your brother  Whatever the story is Adopted or complicated  Im sure theres a big history  And your contender My dear friend  if you were to give me  hours  I could bring them both back to you Alive  I could do it in two  I could do it in one  Lets stop there  You know what I woke up this morning  thinking about a public execution  But for now Ill settle for this sweet little   Whos gonna get him first  So youre on the clock  What have you done  I dont answer to you lackey  Its Loki  And you will answer to the Grandmaster    Hmm  Why would you help my brother escape with that green fool  I dont help anyone  Youre a Valkyrie  I thought the Valkyrie had all died gruesome deaths  Choose your next words wisely  Im terribly sorry Must be a very painful memory   The suns going down Its getting really low  The suns going down   Its getting real low  Oh shoot   Suns getting low  Would you stop saying that  I just need you to stay calm  Calm Im on an alien planet  Its just a planet Youve been on a planet before  Yeah One  Now youve been on two Thats a good thing  Its a new experience  My neurons theyre firing faster  than my brain can handle the information  The whole thing is totally different this time  In the past I always felt like Hulk and I  each had a hand on the wheel  But this time its like he had the keys  to the car and I was locked in the trunk  All right well youre back now Thats all that matters  No its not what matters  What Im trying to tell you is that  if I turn into the Hulk again  Banner may never come back  And were stranded on a planet  that is designed to stress me out  Were not stranded  Im gonna figure out a way to get us home  Thank you  Not your home though Asgard My home  What  Listen my people are in great danger  You and I we have to fight this really powerful being  who also happens to be my sister  Okay that is so wrong on so many  I dont wanna fight your sister  Thats a family issue  No shes an evil being  I dont care what she is  Im not fighting any more beings Im sick of it   What  I just told you  If I turn into the Hulk  I am never gonna come back again  And you dont care  No no Im putting together the team  The Hulk is the fire  Wait youre just using me to get to the Hulk   What No  Its gross  You dont care about me Youre not my friend  No I dont even like the Hulk  Hes all like  Smash smash smash  I prefer you  Thanks  But if Im being honest  when it comes to fighting evil beings  he is very powerful and useful  Yeah Banners powerful and useful too  Is he though  How many PhDs does Hulk have Zero  How many PhDs does Banner have Seven  Fine you dont have to fight anyone  But were in danger here so we have to move  What are you doing with that  I need a disguise Im a fugitive   I need a disguise  You are the disguise   Ill be Tony Stark  What  Yeah Tony and the gypsy  No no youre not Tony Youre Bruce Bruce Banner  Then why did you dress me up like Tony  Because you were naked  Okay Ill give you that  What are you doing Stop doing that  Tony wears his pants super tight   Stop it  Im sorry   Why are you being so weird  I dont know  Maybe the fact that I was trapped for two years  inside of a monster made me a little weird  Hey Shh Its okay  Youre good Calm down Come on  Listen were gonna go to Asgard  and youre not gonna have to think about  the Hulk ever again   All right  All right     Hulk  Oh This is bad  Banner Banner  Banned    Banned  Thor    Hi  Hi  I was gonna do that  Yeah Well I did it first  Thats good What are you doing here  What are you doing here I thought you were leaving  I got sidetracked  Whats with the  Its my disguise  But I can see your face  Not when I do this you cant  Your hair looks nice I like what you did with it  Change it Washed it maybe What are those things on her eyes  Are those the people that shes killed  Shes so beautiful and strong and courageous  Who is this guy   Hes a friend  Who Me   Im Bruce  I feel like I know you  I feel like I know you too    Look Ive spent years in a haze  trying to forget my past  Mmm  Sakaar seemed like the best place  to drink and forget and to die one day  I was thinking that you drink too much  and that probably was gonna kill you  I dont plan to stop drinking   Oh  But I dont wanna forget  I cant turn away any more  so if Im gonna die  well it may as well be driving my sword  through the heart of that murderous hag   Good  Yeah  So Im saying that I wanna be on the team  Has it got a name  Yeah its called the Revengers  Revengers  Because Im getting revenge Youre getting revenge    Do you want revenge   Im undecided  Okay  Also Ive got a peace offering  Surprise    Ow  Just had to be sure  Hello Bruce  So last time I saw you  you were trying to kill everybody  Where are you at these days  It varies from moment to moment Is that a Dragonfang  It is My God  This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie  Sakaar and Asgard are about as far apart  as any two known systems  Our best bet is a Wormhole just outside of city limits  Refuel on Xandar and we can be back in Asgard  in  months  Nope We are going through the big one  The Devils Anus  Anus  Wait wait wait Whose anus  For the record I didnt know  it was called that when I picked it  That looks like a collapsing neutron star  inside of an EinsteinRosen Bridge  We need another ship  That would tear mine to pieces Shes right We need one that can withstand  the geodetic strain from the singularity  And has an offline power steering system  that could also function without the onboard computer  And we need one with cup holders  because were gonna die So drinks  Do I know you I feel like I know you  I feel like I know you too Its weird What do you say  Uncharted metagalactic travel  through a volatile cosmic gateway  Talk about an adventure   We need a ship  Need a ship  There are one or two ships  Absolute top of the line models  I dont mean to impose    But the Grandmaster has a great many ships  I may even have stolen  the access codes to his security system  And suddenly youre overcome  with an urge to do the right thing  Heavens no  Ive run out of favour with the Grandmaster  and in exchange for codes and access to a ship  Im asking for safe passage through the Anus  Youre telling us that you can get us  access into the garage  without setting off any alarms  Yes brother I can  Okay can I just  A quick FYI  I was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago  and he was totally ready to kill any of us  He did try to kill me  Yes me too On many many occasions  There was one time when we were children  he transformed himself into a snake  and he knows that I love snakes  So I went to pick up the snake to admire it  and he transformed back into himself  and he was like Yeah its me  And he stabbed me We were eight at the time If were boosting a ship  were gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace  Why not set the beast loose  Shut up  You guys have a beast  No theres no beast Hes just being stupid  Were going to start a revolution   Revolution  Ill explain later   Whos this guy again  Ill explain later  Is that some sort of protoplasm  all the stuff thats coming out of you  or are they $  Looks like eggs   Oh   Im looking for Korg  Whos asking  I know youre asking  Is anyone else asking or is it just you  The Lord of Thunder sends his best    The revolution has begun  Revolution How did this happen  Dont know  But the arenas mainframe  for the Obedience Disks have been deactivated  and the slaves have armed themselves  Oh I dont like that word  Which Mainframe  No Why would I not like mainframe  No the S word  Sorry the prisoners with jobs have armed themselves  Okay thats better    Hey so listen We should talk  I disagree  Open communication was never our familys forte  You have no idea  Been quite the revelation since we last spoke  Hello  Hi  Odin brought us together  Its almost poetic that his death should split us apart  We might as well be strangers now  Two sons of the crown set adrift   Oh   Thought you didnt wanna talk about it  Heres the thing  Im probably better off staying here on Sakaar  Thats exactly what I was thinking  Did you just agree with me  Come on this place is perfect for you  Its savage chaotic lawless  Brother youre gonna do great here  Do you truly think so little of me  Loki l thought the world of you  I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever  But at the end of the day youre you and Im me  I dont know maybe theres still good in you  But lets be honest  our paths diverged a long time ago  Yeah  Its probably for the best  that we never see each other again  Thats what you always wanted    Hey lets do Get Help   What Get Help  No   Come on you love it  I hate it  Its great It works every time   Its humiliating  Do you have a better plan   No  Were doing it  We are not doing Get Help    Get help Please  My brother hes dying  Get help Help him  Classic   Still hate it   Its humiliating  Not for me its not  Now which ones the ship she told us to get  The Commodore Right  Though I feel it wont make much of a difference  Oh Loki  I know Ive betrayed you many times before  but this time its truly nothing personal  The reward for your capture  will set me up nicely   Never one for sentiment were you  Easier to let it burn  I agree    Oh that looks painful  Oh dear brother youre becoming predictable  I trust you you betray me  Round and round in circles we go  See Loki life is about its about growth  Its about change  But you seem to just wanna stay the same  I guess what Im trying to say  is that youll always be the God of Mischief  but you could be more  Ill just put this over here for you  Anyway all got places to be so good luck  All right I can figure this out  Its just another spaceship    Loyal Sakaarians  Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship  and my favourite champion  Sakaarians take to the skies Bring him down  Do not let him leave this planet   Good shot  Thanks  Open the doors  Okay  I hope that youre tougher than you look  Why       Shouldnt we be shooting back or something  Yes we should  Where are the guns on this ship There arent any   Its a leisure vessel  What  Grandmaster uses it for his good times  orgies and stuff  Did she just say the Grandmaster  uses it for orgies  Yeah  Dont touch anything    No     No  No    Get inside  In a minute    I should probably go and help Here take the wheel  No I dont know how to fly one of these  Youre a scientist Use one of your PhDs  None of them are for flying alien spaceships  Okay come on  Theres gotta be a gun on this thing  That looks like a gun  Its my birthday  Its my birthday  Its my birthday      Yeah     Guys were coming up on the Devils Anus  There she is  Our ticket out of here  Hey whats this     Thank you  Hey man Were about to jump on that ginormous spaceship  You wanna come  You do seem like  youre in desperate need of leadership  Why thank you  Here we go  Shit       Asgardians  some misguided soul  has stolen the Bifrost sword  Tell us where it is  or there will be consequences  Bad ones  Well  You          Well Executioner    Wait  Wait  I know where the sword is  I never thought Id be back here I thought itd be a lot nicer  I mean not that its not nice  Its just its on fire  Here up here in the mountains  Heat signatures People clustered together  Shes coming for them  Okay drop me off at the palace  and Ill draw her away  And get yourself killed  The people trapped down there are all that matters  While Im dealing with Hela I need you two  to help get everyone off Asgard  How the hell are we supposed to do that  I have a man on the ground    Asgard  Shes here  Now the ship has a gun  Ill take it from here  I found this in the armoury  Good luck  Your Majesty  dont die  You know what I mean We must keep moving  Go to the Bifrost    Sister  Youre still alive  I love what youve done with the place  Redecorating I see  It seems our fathers solution  to every problem was to cover it up  Or to cast it out  He told you you were worthy He said the same thing to me  You see  You never knew him  Not at his best  Odin and I drowned entire civilisations  in blood and tears  Where do you think all this gold came from  And then one day  he decided to become a benevolent king  To foster peace to protect life  to have you  I understand why youre angry  And you are my sister and technically  have a claim to the throne  And believe me I would love for someone else to rule  But it cant be you  Youre just  The worst  Okay get up  Youre in my seat  You know Father once told me  that a wise king never seeks out war  But must always be ready for it        Go back     Go  To be honest I expected more  Heimdall  The sword    Heres the difference between us  Im Odins firstborn  the rightful heir the saviour of Asgard   And youre nothing       So simple even a blind man could see it    Oh  Now you remind me of Dad      The stupid dog wont die    Everythings gonna be all right now I got this  You wanted to know who I am  What the hell are you talking about  Youll see                You see No ones going anywhere  Ill get that sword  even if I have to kill every single one of them to do it  Hey man  Im Korg This is Miek  Were gonna jump on that spaceship  and get out of here Wanna come    Your saviour is here      Did you miss me  Everyone on that ship now  Welcome home I saw you coming  Of course you did      Its a valiant effort but you never stood a chance  You see  Im not a queen or a monster  Im the Goddess of Death  What were you the god of again    Even when you had two eyes  youd see only half the picture  Shes too strong Without my hammer I cant  Are you Thor the God of Hammers Hmm    That hammer was to help you control your power  to focus it  It was never your source of strength  Its too late Shes already taken Asgard  Asgard is not a place Never was  This could be Asgard  Asgard is where our people stand  Even now right now those people need your help  Im not as strong as you  No  youre stronger  Tell me brother  What were you the god of again                  Youre late  Youre missing an eye This isnt over    I think we should disband the Revengers  Hit her with a lightning blast  I just hit her with the biggest lightning blast  in the history of lightning  It did nothing  We just need to hold her off until everyones on board  It wont end there  The longer Helas on Asgard the more powerful she grows  Shell hunt us down  We need to stop her here and now  So what do we do  Im not doing Get Help  Asgards not a place its a people  Loki  this was never about stopping Ragnarok  This was about causing Ragnarok  Surturs crown the vault  Its the only way  Bold move brother  Even for me  Shall we  After you      This is madness    Go Go now          For Asgard Hela          With the Eternal Flame you are reborn    Hela enough  You want Asgard its yours  Whatever game youre playing it wont work  You cant defeat me  No I know  But he can    No    Tremble before me Asgard  I am your reckoning  The people are safe  Thats all that matters Were fulfilling the prophecy  I hate this prophecy  So do I but we have no choice  Surtur destroys Asgard  he destroys Hela so that our people may live  But we need to let him finish the job  otherwise   No    Hulk stop you moron       Hulk stop  Just for once in your life dont smash  Big monster  Lets go    Fine     I am Asgards doom    The damage is not too bad  As long as the foundations are still strong  we can rebuild this place  It will become a haven  for all peoples and aliens of the universe  Now those foundations are gone Sorry    What have I done  You saved us from extinction  Asgard is not a place  its a people  It suits you  Maybe youre not so bad after all brother  Maybe not  Thank you  If you were here I might even give you a hug  Im here  Your throne  So King of Asgard  Where to  Im not sure  AW Suggestions  Miek where are you from  Oh Mieks dead  Yeah no I accidentally stomped on him on the bridge  Ive just felt so guilty  Ive been carrying him around all day    Miek youre alive  Hes alive guys  What was your question again bro  Earth it is    Do you really think its a good idea  to go back to Earth  Yes of course  The people of Earth love me Im very popular  Let me rephrase that  Do you really think its a good idea  to bring me back to Earth  Probably not to be honest  I wouldnt worry brother  I feel like everythings gonna work out fine        Oh boy     on  I just gotta say Im proud of you all  This revolution has been a huge success Yay us  Pat on the back Pat on the back  Come on No  Me

       "' now i know what youre thinking  oh no thors in a cage how did this happen  well sometimes you have to get captured  just to get a straight answer out of somebody  its a long story  but basically im a bit of a hero  see i spent some time on earth  fought some robots  saved the planet a couple of times  then i went searching through the cosmos  for some magic colourful infinity stone things  didnt find any  thats when i came across  a path of death and destruction  which led me all the way here into this cage  where i met you  hmm  how much longer do you think well be here        thor son of odin  surtur son of a bitch  youre still alive  i thought my father killed you a half a million years ago  i cannot die  not until i fulfil my destiny  and lay waste to your home  its funny you should mention that  because ive been having these terrible dreams of late  asgard up in flames falling to ruins  and you surtur  are at the centre of all of them  then you have seen ragnarok the fall of asgard   the great prophecy  hang on   hang on   ill be back around shortly  i really feel like we were connecting there    okay so ragnarok  tell me about that walk me through it  my time has come  when my crown is reunited with the eternal flame  i shall be restored to my full might  i will tower over the mountains  and bury my sword deep in asgards oh hang on give it a second  i swear im not even moving  its just doing this on its own   im really sorry   okay so let me get this straight  youre going to put your crown into the eternal flame  and then youll suddenly grow as big as a house  a mountain  the eternal flame that odin keeps locked away on asgard  odin is not on asgard  and your absence has left the throne defenseless  okay so where is it this crown  this is my crown the source of my power  oh thats a crown  i thought it was a big eyebrow  its a crown  anyway it sounds like all i have to do to stop ragnarok  is rip that thing off your head   but ragnarok has already begun  you cannot stop it    i am asgards doom and so are you  all will suffer all will burn  oh thats intense  to be honest seeing you grow really big  and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle  but it looks like im gonna have to choose option b  where i bust out of these chains  knock that tiara off your head  and stash it away in asgards vault  you cannot stop ragnarok  why fight it  because thats what heroes do   hmm  wait im sorry i didnt time that right    hmm  and now      you have made a grave mistake odinson  i make grave mistakes all the time    everything seems to work out                  huh    heimdall i know its been a while  but i could really use a fast exit  heimdall heimdall was an idiot  this job should have made him rich  now the job aint easy  but it does have its benefits  the bifrost gives me access to everything  the nine realms has to offer  i mean its all mine for the taking  behold  my stuff  ooh  im particularly fond of these  i pulled them out of a place on midgard called texas  i even named them des and troy  you see when you put them together  they destroy    heimdall come on      stay  heimdall im running short on options   heimdall   um skurge    is that important you girls are in for a treat              girls  well well well look who decided to pop in  thanks for scaring away my company  and drenching my workplace in brains  who are you  dont you remember im skurge  we fought together on vanaheim  right where is heimdall  that traitor no one knows hes a fugitive of the throne  traitor  yeah well you see odin charged heimdall  with negligence of duty  but he disappeared before the trial  hard to catch a guy  who can see everything in the universe  sure  hold on im supposed to announce your arrival        what the hell is that     oh brother this is it  i take my leave   you fool you didnt listen   im sorry  lady sif get help  somebody help   sorry for all ive done  shh its all right hold on  im sorry i tried to rule earth  theyd be lucky to have you  im sorry about that thing with the tesseract   i just couldnt help myself  i know  im a trickster  so mischievous  sorry about that time i turned you into a frog  it was a wonderful joke  twas indeed hilarious    you are the saviour of asgard   tell my story  i will  build a statue for me  we will build a big statue for you  with my helmet on with the big bendy horns  i will tell father what you did here today  i didnt do it for him  i didnt do it for him      no    and so loki died of his wounds  giving his life for ours  he fought back those disgusting elves  he brought peace to the realm  loki my boy  twas many moons ago i found you  on that frostbitten battlefield  on that day i did not yet see in you  asgards saviour no  you were merely a little blue baby icicle  that melted this old fools heart    bravo bravo well done bravo  father  oh shit  uh my son thor has returned   greetings my boy   its an interesting play whats it called  the tragedy of loki of asgard  the people wanted to commemorate him ah indeed they should  i like the statue  a lot better looking than he was when he was alive though  a little less weasely less greasy maybe  do you know what this is  the skull of surtur thats a formidable weapon  do me a favour lock this away in a vault  so it doesnt turn into a giant monster  and destroy the whole planet  thank you dear um  so its back to midgard for you is it  nope  ive been having this reoccurring dream lately  every night i see asgard fall into ruins thats just a silly dream  signs of an overactive imagination possibly  but then i decide to go out there and investigate  and what do i find  but the nine realms completely in chaos  enemies of asgard assembling plotting our demise  all while you odin  the protector of those nine realms  are sitting here in your bathrobe  eating grapes  yes it is best to respect our neighbours freedom  yes of course the freedom to be massacred  yes besides ive been rather busy myself  watching theatre  board meetings and security council meetings  youre really gonna make me do it  do what    you know that nothing will stop mjolnir  as it returns to my hand  not even your face  youve gone quite mad youll be executed for this  then ill see you on the other side brother  all right i yield    behold  thor   odinson  no  you had one job just the one  wheres odin  you just couldnt stay away could you  everything was fine without you  asgard was prospering youve ruined everything   ask them  wheres father   did you kill him  you had what you wanted  you had the independence you asked for   whoa whoa whoa  okay i know exactly where he is    i swear i left him right here right here on the sidewalk  or

crazy  ive gained his favour  the bifrost brought me out here weeks ago   weeks ago  yes  i just got here   what are you whispering about    time works real different around these parts  on any other

direction would be this way lord  ah loki    hey hey hey take it easy man    over here  the pile of rocks waving at you here  yeah im actually a thing im a being  allow me to introduce myself my name is korg  im kind of like the leader in here  im made of rocks as you can see  but dont let that intimidate you  you dont need to be afraid  unless youre made of scissors   just a little rockpaperscissor  joke for you  this is my very good friend over here miek  hes an insect and has knives for hands  youre a kronan arent you   that i am  howd you end up in here  ah well i tried to start a revolution  but didnt print enough pamphlets  so hardly anyone turned up  except for my mum and her boyfriend who i hate  as punishment i was forced  to be in here and become a gladiator  bit of a promotional disaster that one  but im actually organising another revolution  i dont know if youd be interested  in something like that  do you reckon youd be interested  how did you  ah yeah no this whole thing is a circle  but not a real circle more like a freaky circle  this doesnt make any sense  no nothing makes sense here man  the only thing that does make sense  is that nothing makes sense  has anyone here fought the grandmasters champion  doug has  doug  our luck dougs dead  thats right  everyone who fights  the grandmasters champion perishes  what about you youre made of rocks  perishable rock there you go another one gone  yeah no i just do the smaller fights  warm up the crowd and whatnot  wait youre not gonna face him are you  yes i am  gonna fight him win  and get the hell out of this place  thats exactly what doug used to say  see you later new doug  does no one remember me  has no one been taught our history  look at these lies  goblets and garden parties  peace treaties  odin  proud to have it  ashamed of how he got it    we were unstoppable  i was his weapon in the conquest  that built asgards empire  one by one the realms became ours  but then simply because my ambition outgrew his  he banished me caged me locked me away like an animal  before that asgards warriors were honoured  their bodies buried as heroes beneath this very palace   odins treasures  fake    most of the stuff in here is fake  or weak  smaller than i thought it would be  thats not bad   but this  the eternal flame    want to see what true power really looks like    fenris my darling what have they done to you  with the eternal flame you are reborn    ive missed you  ive missed you all odin  i bid you take your place in the halls of valhalla  where the brave shall live forever  nor shall we mourn but rejoice  for those that have died the glorious death  hurts doesnt it  being lied to  being told youre one thing  and then learning its all a fiction  you didnt think id really come and see you did you  this place is disgusting    does this mean you dont want my help  look i couldnt jeopardise my position with the grandmaster  it took me time to win his trust  hes a lunatic but he can be amenable  what im telling you is  you could join me at the grandmasters side  perhaps in time  an accident befalls the grandmaster and then      youre not seriously thinking of going back are you  our sister destroyed your hammer  like a piece of glass  shes stronger than both of us shes stronger than you  you dont stand a chance  do you understand what im saying to you    fine  i guess ill just have to go it alone  like ive always done  would you say something  say something  what would you like me to say  you faked your own death  you stole the throne stripped odin of his power  stranded him on earth to die  releasing the goddess of death  have i said enough or would you like me to go back  further than the past two days  you know i havent seen this  beloved champion he talks of  but ive heard he is astonishingly savage  ive placed a large wager against you tomorrow  dont let me down   piss off ghost  hes freaking gone   oh yuck  theres still someones hair and blood all over this  guys can you clean up the weapons  once you finish your fight  disgusting slobs  oh thor  wanna use a big wooden fork  no  yeah not really useful  unless youre fighting off three vampires  that were huddled together  i really wish i had my hammer  hammer  quite unique it was made from this  special metal from the heart of a dying star  and when i spun it really really fast  it gave me the ability to fly  you rode a hammer  no i didnt ride the hammer  the hammer rode you on your back  no i used to spin it really fast  and it would pull me off the  oh my god a hammer pulled you off  the ground it would pull me off the ground  up into the air and i would fly  every time i threw it  it would always come back to me  sounds like you had a pretty special  and intimate relationship with this hammer  and that losing it  was almost comparable to losing a loved one  thats a nice way of putting it  i said theyre mine  see her thats the one that put me in here  oh yeah scrapper   gotta watch out for those asgardians man  they are hard to perish  asgardian  hey hey  hey  do not zap me with that thing i just wanna talk  asgard is in danger  my god youre a valkyrie  i used to wanna be a valkyrie when i was younger  until i found out that you were all women  theres nothing wrong with women of course  i love women  sometimes a little too much  not in a creepy way  just more of a respectful appreciation  i think its great that there is  an elite force of women warriors  its about time  are you done lord of thunder youre up  please help me i need your help  bye  fine then you must be a traitor or a coward  because the valkyrie is sworn to protect the throne  listen closely your majesty this is sakaar not asgard  and im a scrapper not a

the best place  to drink and forget and to die one day  i was thinking that you drink too much  and that probably was gonna kill you  i dont plan to stop drinking   oh  but i dont wanna forget  i cant turn away any more  so if im gonna die  well it may as well be driving my sword  through the heart of that murderous hag   good  yeah  so im saying that i wanna be on the team  has it got a name  yeah

hello bruce  so last time i saw you  you were trying to kill everybody  where are you at these days  it varies from moment to moment is that a dragonfang  it is my god  this is the famed sword of the valkyrie  sakaar and asgard are about as far apart  as any two known systems  our best bet is a wormhole just outside of city limits  refuel on xandar and we can be back in asgard  in  months  nope we are going through the big one  the devils anus  anus  wait wait wait whose anus  for the record i didnt know  it was called that when i picked it  that looks like a collapsing neutron star  inside of an einsteinrosen bridge  we need another ship  that would tear mine to pieces shes right we need one that can withstand  the geodetic strain from the singularity  and has an offline power steering system  that could also function without the onboard computer  and we need one with cup holders  because were gonna die so drinks  do i know you i feel like i know you  i feel like i know you too its weird what do you say  uncharted metagalactic travel  through a volatile cosmic gateway  talk about an adventure   we need a ship  need a ship  there are one or two ships  absolute top of the line models  i dont mean to impose    but the grandmaster has a great many ships  i may even have stolen  the access codes to his security system  and suddenly youre overcome  with an urge to do the right thing  heavens no  ive run out of favour with the grandmaster  and in exchange for codes and access to a ship  im asking for safe passage through the anus  youre telling us that you can get us  access into the garage  without setting off any alarms  yes brother i can  okay can i just  a quick fyi  i was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago  and he was totally ready to kill any of us  he did try to kill me  yes me too on many many occasions  there was one time when we were children  he transformed himself into a snake  and he knows that i love snakes  so i went to pick up the snake to admire it  and he transformed back into himself  and he was like yeah its me  and he stabbed me we were eight at the time if were boosting a ship  were gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace  why not set the beast loose  shut up  you guys have a beast  no theres no beast hes just being stupid  were going to start a revolution   revolution  ill explain later   whos this guy again  ill explain later  is that some sort of protoplasm  all the stuff thats coming out of you  or are they $  looks like eggs   oh   im looking for korg  whos asking  i know youre asking  is anyone else asking or is it just you  the lord of thunder sends his best    the revolution has begun  revolution how did this happen  dont know  but the arenas mainframe  for the obedience disks have been deactivated  and the slaves have armed themselves  oh i dont like that word  which mainframe  no why would i not like mainframe  no the s word  sorry the prisoners with jobs have armed themselves  okay thats better    hey so listen we should talk  i disagree  open communication was never our familys forte  you have no idea  been quite the revelation since we last spoke  hello  hi  odin brought us together  its almost poetic that his death should split us apart  we might as well be strangers now  two sons of the crown set adrift   oh   thought you didnt wanna talk about it  heres the thing  im probably better off staying here on sakaar  thats exactly what i was thinking  did you just agree with me  come on this place is perfect for you  its savage chaotic lawless  brother youre gonna do great here  do you truly think so little of me  loki l thought the world of you  i thought we were gonna fight side by side forever  but at the end of the day youre you and im me  i dont know maybe theres still good in you  but lets be honest  our paths diverged a long time ago  yeah  its probably for the best  that we never see each other again  thats what you always wanted    hey lets do get help   what get help  no   come on you love it  i hate it  its great it works every time   its humiliating  do you have a better plan   no  were doing it  we are not doing get help    get help please  my brother hes dying  get help help him  classic   still hate it   its humiliating  not for me its not  now which ones the ship she told us to get  the commodore right  though i feel it wont make much of a difference  oh loki  i know ive betrayed you many times before  but this time its truly nothing personal  the reward for your capture  will set me up nicely   never one for sentiment were you  easier to let it burn  i agree    oh that looks painful  oh dear brother youre becoming predictable  i trust you you betray me  round and round in circles we go  see loki life is about its about growth  its about change  but you seem to just wanna stay the same  i guess what im trying to say  is that youll always be the god of mischief  but you could be more  ill just put this over here for you  anyway all got places to be so good luck  all right i can figure this out  its just another spaceship    loyal sakaarians  lord of thunder has stolen my ship  and my favourite champion  sakaarians take to the skies bring him down  do not let him leave this planet   good shot  thanks  open the doors  okay  i hope that youre tougher than you look  why       shouldnt we be shooting back or something  yes we should  where are the guns on this ship there arent any   its a leisure vessel  what  grandmaster uses it for his good times  orgies and stuff  did she just say the grandmaster  uses it for orgies  yeah  dont touch anything    no     no  no    get inside  in a minute    i should probably go and help here take the wheel  no i dont know how to fly one of these  youre a scientist use one of your phds  none of them are for flying alien spaceships  okay come on  theres gotta be a gun on this thing  that looks like a gun  its my birthday  its my birthday  its my birthday      yeah     guys were coming up on the devils anus  there she is  our ticket out of here  hey whats this     thank you  hey man were about to jump on that ginormous spaceship  you wanna

youre still alive  i love what youve done with the place  redecorating i see  it seems our fathers solution  to every problem was to cover it up  or to cast it out  he told you you were worthy he said the same thing to me  you see  you never knew him  not at his best  odin and i drowned entire civilisations  in blood and tears  where do you think all this gold came from  and then one day  he decided to become a benevolent king  to foster peace to protect life  to have you  i understand why youre angry  and you are my sister and technically  have a claim to the throne  and believe me i would love for someone else to rule  but it cant be you  youre just  the worst  okay get up  youre in my seat  you know father once told me  that a wise king never seeks out war  but must always be ready for it        go back     go  to be honest i expected more  heimdall  the sword    heres the difference between us  im odins firstborn  the rightful heir the saviour of asgard   and youre

 shes too strong without my hammer i cant  are you thor the god of hammers hmm    that hammer was to help you control your power  to focus it  it was never your source of strength  its too late shes already taken asgard  asgard is not a place never was  this could be asgard  asgard is where our people stand  even now right now those people need your help  im not as strong as you  no  youre stronger  tell me brother  what were you the god of again                  youre late  youre missing an eye this isnt over    i think we should disband the revengers  hit her with a lightning blast  i

more powerful she grows  shell hunt us down  we need to stop her here and now  so what do we do  im not doing get help  asgards not a place its a people  loki  this was never about stopping ragnarok  this was about causing ragnarok  surturs crown the vault  its the only way  bold move brother  even for me  shall we  after you      this is madness    go go now          for asgard hela          with

terror of staring into a void of space id say im feeling better today the infections run its course thanks to the blue meanie back there  youd love her very practical only a tiny bit sadistic some

about this i mean if you grovel for a couple of weeks and then move on with enormous guilt i should probably lie down please know that when i drift off i will think about you because its always you    couldnt stop him neither could i i lost the kid tony we lost is uh  oh my god oh my god  its okay  its been  days since thanos came to earth world governments are in pieces the parts that are still working are trying to take a census and it looks like he did he did exactly what he said he was gonna do thanos wiped out fifty percent of all living creatures where is he now where we dont know he just opened a portal and walked through  whats wrong with him oh hes pissed he thinks he failed which of course he did but you know theres a lot of thats going around aint there honestly until this exact second i thought you were a buildabear maybe i am weve been hunting thanos for three weeks now deep space scans and satellites and we got nothing tony you fought him who told you that  i didnt fight him no he wiped my face with a planet while the bleecker street magician gave away the store thats what happened there was no fight okay hes unbeatable did he give you any clues any coordinates anything pfft i saw this coming a few years back i had a vision i didnt wanna believe it thought i was dreaming tony im gonna need you to focus  and i needed you as in past tense that trumps what you need its too late buddy sorry you know what i need  i need to shave and i believe i remember telling all youse   tony tony tony alive and otherwise what we needed was a suit of armor around the world remember that whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not thats what we needed well that didnt work out did it i said wed lose you said well do that together too and guess what cap we lost and you werent there but thats what we do right our best work after the fact were the avengers were the avengers not the prevengers okay right you made your point just sit down okay okay nah nah heres my point you know what tony youre sick  shes great by the way sit down sit we need you youre new blood bunch of tired old mules  i got nothing for you cap i got no coordinates no clues no strategies no options zero zip nada no trust liar  here take this you find him and you put that on you hide  tony im fine i   bruce gave him a sedative hes gonna probably be out for the rest of the day you guys take care of him and ill bring him a xorrian elixir when i come back  where are you going to kill thanos  hey you know we usually work as a team here and between you and i morales a little fragile we realize up there is more your territory but this is our fight too you even know where he is i know people who might  dont bother i can tell you where thanos is thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me and when he worked he talked about his great plan even disassembled i wanted to please him id ask where would we go once his plan was complete his answer was always the  to the garden thats cute thanos has a retirement plan so where is he when thanos snapped his fingers earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions no ones ever seen anything like it until two days ago  on this planet thanos is there he used the stones again hey hey hey wed be going in shorthanded you know look hes still got the stones so so lets get him use them to bring everyone back just like that yeah just like that  even if theres a small chance that we can undo this i mean we owe it to everyone whos not in this room to try if we do this how do we know its gonna end any differently than it did before because before you didnt have me hey new girl everyone here is about that superhero life and if you dont mind my asking where the hell have you been all this time there are a lot of other planets in the universe and unfortunately they didnt have you guys  i like this one  lets go get this son of a bitch    okay who here hasnt been to space  why you better not throw up on my ship approaching jump in     ill head down for recon  this is gonna work steve i know it will  cause i dont know what im going to do if it doesnt  no satellites no ships no armies no ground defenses of any kind its just him and thats enough    oh no where are they answer the question the universe required correction after that the stones served no purpose beyond temptation you murdered trillions  you should be grateful  where are the stones gone reduced to atoms you used them two days ago i used the stones to destroy the stones it nearly killed me but the work is done it always will be  i am inevitable we have to tear this place apart hehehe has to be lying my father is many things a liar is not one of them ah thank you daughter  perhaps i treated you too harshly  what what did you do  i went for the head  five  years  later   so i uh went on a date the other day its the first time in five years you know im sitting there at dinner i didnt even know what to talk about what did you talk about same old crap you know how things have changed and my job his job how much we miss the mets and then things get quiet he cried as they were serving the salads what about you i cried just before dessert but im seeing him again tomorrow so thats great you did the hardest part you took the jump you didnt know where you were gonna come down and thats it thats those little brave baby steps we gotta take to try and become whole again try and find purpose i went in the ice in  right after i met the love of my life woke up  years later you gotta move on gotta to move on the world is in our hands its left to us guys and we got to do something with it otherwise thanos should have killed all of us  the camera pans to san francisco bridge all the way to a selfstorage facility with a sign saying ustore it self storage with its interior filled with stored stuff and junk until it spots luis van from antman and the wasp behind a metallic fence with a label named lang a rat crawls over the vans rear windshield and accidentally activates the controls for opening the quantum realm haphazardly activating the quantum tunnel the rear door busts open flinging lang outside the van

lang in his casual clothing shouting waving a sign with the word help written on it   kid hey kid  what the hell happened here  no please please please  no no no no  excuse me sorry no cassie no   please please please please no cassie  what   cassie dad  youre so big   yeah we boarded that highly suspect warship danvers pinged  it was an infectious garbage scowl so thanks for the hot tip  well you were closer yeah and now we smell like garbage  you get a reading on those tremors it was a mild subduction under the african plate do we have a visual how are we handling it nat its an earthquake under the ocean we handle it by not handling it  carol are we seeing you here next month not likely what you gonna get another haircut  listen furface im covering a lot of territory the things that are happening on earth are happening everywhere on thousands of planets  all right all right thats a good point thats a good point so you might not see me for a long time alright uh well this channel is always active so if anything goes sideways anyones making trouble where they shouldnt comes through me  okay alright   good luck   where are you mexico the federales found a room full of bodies looks like a bunch of cartel guys never even had the chance to get their guns off its probably a rival gang except it isnt  its definitely barton what hes done here what hes been doing for the last few years i mean the scene that he left  i gotta tell you theres a part of me that doesnt even want to find him  will you find out where hes going next nat please  okay   you know id offer to cook you dinner but you seem pretty miserable already  you here to do your laundry and to see a friend clearly your friend is fine you know i saw a pod of whales when i was coming up the bridge in the hudson theres fewer ships cleaner water you know if youre about to tell me to look on the bright side um im about you to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich  sorry force of habit  you know i keep telling everybody they should move on and grow some do but not us if i move on who does this maybe it doesnt need to be done  i used to have nothing and then i got this this job this family and i was i was better because of it and even though theyre gone im still trying to be better i think we both need to get a life  you first  oh hi hi is anyone home this is scott lang we met a few years ago at the airport in germany i got really big and i had my mask on you wouldnt recognize me  is this an old message  its the front gate antman antman i know you know that i need to talk to you guys  scott are you okay yeah im fine  have you ever studied quantum physics only to make conversation alright so five years ago right before thanos i was in a place called the quantum realm the quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe to get in there you have to be incredibly small hope shes my she was my  she was supposed to pull me out and then thanos happened and i got stuck in there im sorry that mustve been a very long five years yeah but thats just it it wasnt for me it was five hours  see the rules of the quantum realm arent like they are up here everything is unpredictable is that anybodys sandwich im starving  scott what are you talking about what im saying is time works differently in the quantum realm the only problem is right now we dont have a way to navigate it but what if we did i cant stop thinking about it what if we could somehow control the chaos and we could navigate it what if there was a way to enter the quantum realm at a certain point in time but then exit at another point in time like like before thanos wait are you talking about a time machine no no of course not no not a time machine its more like a yeah a time machine i know its crazy but i cant stop thinking about it theres gotta be some way theres gotta besome w its crazy scott i get emails from a raccoon so nothing sounds crazy anymore so who do we talk to about this   chow time  maguna morgan h stark you want some lunch define lunch or be disintegrated  a girl with long dark hair walks out in front of tony this is morgan stark tony and peppers daughter she looks to be about    years of age okay you should not be wearing that okay that is part of a special anniversary gift im making for mom  okay there you go are you thinking about lunch i can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce no thats what you want how did you find this garage really were you looking for it no i found it though you like going to the garage huh so does daddy its fine actually your mom never wears anything i buy her   now we know what it sounds like tony after everything youve seen is anything really impossible quantum fluctuation messes with the planck scale which then triggers the deutsch proposition can we agree on that   thank you in laymans terms it means youre not coming home i did no you accidentally survived its a billion to one cosmic fluke and now you wanna pull off a what do you call it  a time heist yeah a time heist of course why didnt we think of this before oh because its laughable because its a pipedream the stones are in the past we can go back and get them we can snap our own fingers we can bring everyone back or screw it up worse than he already has right i dont believe we would gotta say sometimes i miss that giddy optimism however high hopes wont help if theres no logical tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist i believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel that means no talking to our past selves no betting on sporting events  im gonna stop you right there scott are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on back to the future  no good you had me worried there cause thatd be horse shit thats not how quantum physics works tony we have to take a stand we did stand and yet here we are i know you got a lot on the line you got a wife a daughter but i lost someone very important to me a lot of people did  and now now we have a chance to bring her back to bring everyone back and youre telling me that wont even thats right scott

for the night this time in the shape of a mobius strip inverted please frida processing give me that eigenvalue that particle factoring and a spectral decomp that will take a second frida just a moment and dont worry if it doesnt pan out im just kinda  frida model rendered [in a complete shock of amazement the render comes back as % successful tony falls back bewildered by this discovery] shit shit   what are you doing up little mess shit no we dont say that only mommy says that word she coined it it belongs to her why you up cause i got some important shit going on here  what do you

rogers  i can do this all day  yeah i know i know  steve rogers  where did you get this  bucky is alive steve rogers  what  that is americas ass  please please the ancient one  im sorry i cant help you bruce if i give up the time stone to help your reality im dooming my own with all due respect im not sure the science really supports that  the ancient one  the infinity stones create what you experience as the flow of time remove one stone and that flow splits  now this may benefit your reality but my new one…not so much in this new branched reality without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness our world will be overrun millions will suffer so tell me doctor can your science prevent all that no but we can erase it because once we are done with the stones we can return each one to its own timeline at the moment it was taken so chronologically  in that reality  it never left  the ancient one   but you are leaving out the most important part in order to return the stones you have to survive we will i will i promise the ancient one  i cant risk this reality on a promise it is the duty of the sorcerer supreme to protect the time stone then why the hell did strange give it away the ancient one   what did you say strange he gave it away he gave it to thanos the ancient one  willingly yes the ancient one  why i have no idea maybe he made a mistake the ancient one  or i did  strange is meant to be the best of us so he must have done it for a reason the ancient one  i fear you might be right  thank you the ancient one  im counting on you bruce we all are  thanos   run
