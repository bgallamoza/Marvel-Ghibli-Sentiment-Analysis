[Missouri, Earth, 1980. Meredith Quill & Ego are driving along a dirt road in Missouri singing along to "Brandy you're a fine girl" by Looking Glass. The two get out of the car and run into a forest.]
 Meredith Quill: Where are you taking me?
 Ego: Come on, come on. Look!
 [Meredith spots a seedling that looks not of this Earth.]
 Meredith: Oh, it’s beautiful.
 Ego: I was afraid it wouldn’t take to the soil, but it grew quickly and soon, it will be everywhere, all across the universe!
 Meredith: Well, I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I like the way you say it.
 Ego: My heart is yours, Meredith Quill.
 Meredith: I can’t believe that I fell in love with a spaceman.
 [They kiss]
 [34 Years Later - The Sovereign, The Guardians of the Galaxy, consisting of Peter "Star Lord" Quill, Gamora, Drax and Rocket, stand around waiting for something big to show up.]
 Peter Quill: Show time, A-holes! it will be here any minute.
 Gamora: Which it will be its last.
 Quill: I thought your thing was a sword?
 Gamora: We’ve been hired to stop an inter-dimensional beast from feeding on those batteries and I’m going to stop it with a sword?
 Quill: It’s just… swords were your thing and guns were mine, but… I guess we’re both doing guns now. I just didn’t know that.
 Gamora: Drax, why aren’t you wearing one of Rocket’s Aero-Rigs?
 Drax the Destroyer: It hurts.
 Gamora: Hurts?
 Drax: I have sensitive nipples.
 Rocket Raccoon: [in a mocking tone] Wa-ha-ha-ha! My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!
 Drax: What about him, what’s he doing?
 Rocket: I’m finishing this so we can listen to tunes while we work.
 Drax: How is that important?
 Rocket: Blame Quill, he’s the one who loves music so much!
 Quill: No, I actually agree with Drax on this, that’s hardly important right now.
 Rocket: [winking] Oh, ok, sure Quill
 Quill: No, seriously, I side with Drax.
 Rocket: I understand that, your being very serious right now.
 Drax: I can clearly see you winking!
 Rocket: Damn, I’m using my left eye?
 [Groot, still a baby terrorizes orloni and looks at Rocket.]
 Groot: I am Groot.
 Rocket: They were not looking at you funny. [sees the Abilisk] Oh, well that’s intense.
 [While the Guardians fight off the Abilisk, Baby Groot plugs in the cord to Peter Quill's stereo and starts playing "Mr. Blue Sky" by ELO and begins dancing]
 Quill: Groot!
 Gamora: Groot, get out of the way your going to get hurt! [Baby Groot waves] Hi!
 [Baby Groot continues dancing; Drax falls down next to him and every time he looks at Baby Groot, Baby Groot stops dancing. Baby Groot notices a fly buzzing around and he tries to catch it, he grabs it and puts it in his mouth.]
 Rocket: No, no! Spit it out! Come on! That’s disgusting.
 [Rocket removes the bug from Baby Groot's mouth. Baby Groot hops on top of an Orloni and hops around the giant Abilisk. Baby Groot jumps off the Orloni and continues dancing until Drax falls on top of Peter Quill's stereo and smashes it; Baby Groot gets angry and tries to kick Drax]
 Drax: The beast’s hide is too thick to be pierced from the outside! I must cut through it from the inside.
 Gamora: What? No, Drax! Drax!
 Quill: What’s he doing?!
 Gamora: He said that the skin is to thick to be pierced on the outside so…
 Quill: That doesn’t make any sense!
 Gamora: I tried telling him that!
 Quill: Skin has the same level of thickness on the inside as it is on the outside!
 Gamora: I realize that!
 Quill: There’s a cut on its neck! Rocket, get it to look up!.
 Rocket: Alright, you giant sea monkey, up here! Whoa, watch it Quill!
 Drax: Yes! I have single-handily vanquished the beast! [Groot throws something in his face] What? What are they called again?
 Quill: Anulax batteries.
 Drax: Harbulary batteries.
 Quill: That’s nothing like what I just said. But they’re worth thousands of units apiece… which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them. Careful what you say around these folks. They’re easily offended. The cost of transgression is death.
 Ayesha: We thank you, Guardians, for putting your lives on the line. We could not risk the lives of our own Sovereign citizens. Every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community. Impeccable, both physically and mentally. We control the DNA of our progeny… germinating them in birthing pods.
 Quill: I guess I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way.
 Ayesha: Perhaps someday, you could give me a history lesson… in the archaic ways of our ancestors. For academic purposes.
 Quill: I would be honored, yes. In the name of research…I think that could be pretty, uh… [notices Gamora staring at him and he quickly changes his answer] …repulsive.I’m not into that kind of casual…
 Gamora: [interrupting Peter] Oh, please. Your people promised something in exchange for our services. Bring it… and we shall gladly be on our way.
 [The Sovereign guards bring a hooded figure nto the courtroom and throw her on the ground and pull back her hood, to reveal Gamora’s sister, Nebula]
 Quill: Family reunion. Yay.
 Ayesha: I understand she is your sister.
 Gamora: She’s worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar.
 Ayesha: Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries. Do with her as you please.
 Quill: We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.
 Ayesha: What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?
 Quill: My mother is from Earth.
 Ayesha: And your father?
 Quill: He ain’t from Missouri. That’s all I know.
 Ayesha: I see it within you. An unorthodox genealogy. A hybrid that seems particularly… reckless.
 Rocket: [after hearing Ayesha insulted Peter] You know, they told me you people were conceited douchebags, but that isn’t true at all. [Winks] Oh, shit. I’m using my wrong eye again, aren’t I? I’m sorry. [Drax picks Rocket up from the scruff of his vest and carries him briefly] That was meant to be behind your back. [Drax puts Rocket down]
 Drax: Count yourself blessed they didn’t kill you.
 Rocket: You’re telling me. [shows Drax the batteries] You wanna buy some batteries? [Drax laughs out loud but Rocket quickly shushes him. On The Milano, "Lake Shore Drive" plays] All right, let’s get baldy to Xandar and collect that bounty.
 Quill: That stuff about my father… Who does she think she is?
 Gamora: I know you’re sensitive about that.
 Quill: I’m not sensitive about it. I just don’t know who he is. Sorry if it seemed like I was flirting with the High Priestess. I wasn’t.
 Gamora: I don’t care if you were.
 Quill: Well, I feel like you do care. That’s why I’m apologizing. So, sorry!
 Drax: Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.
 Quill: Damn shadow.
 Drax: There are two types of beings in the universe… those who dance, and those who do not.
 Quill: Mmm-hmm.
 Drax: I first met my beloved at a war rally.
 Quill: Oh, God.
 Drax: Everyone in the village flailed about, dancing. Except one woman. My Ovette. I knew immediately she was the one for me. The most melodic song in the world could be playing. She wouldn’t even tap her foot. Wouldn’t move a muscle. One might assume she was dead.
 Quill: That does sound pretty hot.
 Drax: It would make my nether regions engorge.
 Quill: Okay. I get it, yes. I’m a dancer, Gamora is not.
 Drax: You just need to find a woman who is pathetic… like you.
 Quill: Mmm.
 Nebula: I’m hungry. Hand me some of that yaro root.
 Gamora: No. It’s not ripe yet… and I hate you.
 Nebula: You hate me? You left me there while you stole that stone for yourself. And yet here you stand, a hero. I will be free of these shackles soon enough, and I will kill you. I swear.
 Gamora: No. You’re gonna live out the rest of your days in a prison on Xandar… wishing you could.
 Quill: This is weird, we got a Sovereign fleet approaching from the rear.
 Gamora: Why would they do that?
 Drax: Probably ‘cause Rocket stole some of their batteries.
 Rocket: Dude!
 Drax: [awkwardly] Right… he didn’t steal some of those. I don’t know why they’re after us, what a mystery this is.
 Quill: What were you thinking?
 Rocket: Dude, they were really easy to steal!
 Gamora: That’s your defense?
 Rocket: Come on! You saw how that High Priestess talked down to us. Now I’m teaching her a lesson!
 Quill: I didn’t realize your motivation was altruism. It’s really a shame the Sovereign’s mistaking your intentions and they’re trying to kill us.
 Rocket: Exactly.
 Quill: I was being sarcastic!
 Rocket: Oh, no! You’re supposed to use a sarcastic voice! Now I look foolish!
 Gamora: Can your bickering on a hold until after we survive this massive space battle?
 Quill: More incoming!
 Rocket: Good, I want to kill some guys!
 Sovereign Woman: Damn it!
 Ayesha: What is the delay, Admiral?
 Sovereign Admiral: High Priestess, the batteries, they are exceptionally combustible… and could destroy the entire fleet.
 Ayesha: Our concern is their slight against our people. We hired them and they steal from us. It is heresy of the highest order.
 Sovereign Admiral: All command modules… fire with the intent to kill.
 Quill: What’s the nearest habitable planet?
 Gamora: It’s called Berhert.
 Quill: How many jumps?
 Gamora: Only one. But the access point is 47 clicks away. And you have to go through that quantum asteroid field.
 Drax: Quill, to make it through that you’d have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.
 Quill: Lucky for us, I…
 Rocket: I am. What are you doing?
 Quill: I’ve been flying this rig since I was 10 years old.
 Rocket: I was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft.
 Quill: You were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag!
 Gamora: Stop it.
 Rocket: Later on tonight, you’re gonna be laying down, there’s gonna be something squishy in your pillowcase. And you’re gonna be like, "what’s this?", and it’s gonna be because I put a turd in there.
 Quill: You put your turd in my bed and I shave you!
 Rocket: Oh, it won’t be my turd. It’ll be Drax’s.
 Drax: [laughs] I have famously huge turds!
 Gamora: We’re about to die, and this is what we’re discussing?
 Rocket: Son of a…
 Quill: Dude! Seriously!
 Rocket: Hey! Let me…
 Nebula: Idiots!
 Rocket: [smiles] Well, that’s what you get when Quill flies.
 [Gamora throws something at Rocket]
 Gamora: We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.
 Quill: Our weapons are down.
 Gamora: 20 clicks to the jump! Hold on.
 [Nebula tries to steal another fruit, but Drax kicks it out of her grasp.]
 Drax: It’s not ripe.
 [In Sovereign control, Zylak is one of the few ones controlling a droid.]
 Zylak's Frenemy Come on, Zylak. You can do this.
 All Sovereign: Yes!
 [In the Milano cockpit]
 Gamora: 15 clicks to the jump!
 All Sovereign: Come on! Keep going!
 Gamora: 10 clicks!
 Drax: Die, spaceship!
 [Drax hits the ship with his shot and destroys Zylak's ship]
 Sovereign: You suck, Zylak.
 Sovereign Woman: Typical.
 Gamora: Five clicks!
 Quill: Son of a… They went around the field!
 Sovereign General: Someone destroyed all our ships!
 Ayesha: What? Who?
 Gamora: One click!
 Rocket: What is that?
 Quill: Who cares? That’s the jump point! Go!
 Rocket: It’s a guy.
 Gamora: [noticing Drax is still out there] Oh, my God. He’s still out there?
 Quill: Groot, put your seatbelt on! Prepare for a really bad landing!
 Drax: [laughing] That was awesome! Yes!
 [All the Guardians are out of their ship and notice the Milano is destroyed.]
 Gamora: Look at this! Where is the other half of our ship?
 Quill: My ship.
 Gamora: Either one of you could have gotten us through that field… had you flown with what’s between your ears instead of what’s between your legs!
 Quill: If what’s between my legs had a hand on it… I guarantee I could have landed this ship with it.
 Gamora: [in a scolding tone] Peter, we almost died because of your arrogance.
 Quill: More like because he stole… the Anulax batteries!
 Drax: They’re called Harbulary batteries.
 Quill: No, they’re not!
 Rocket: Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch? Hmm?
 Quill: I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."
 Rocket: I did it because I wanted to!
 Quill: Dick.
 Rocket: What are we even talking about this for? We just had a little man save us by blowing up fifty ships!
 Drax: How little?
 Rocket: [holding his thumb and forefinger close together] Well, I don't know, like this?
 Gamora: [skeptically] A little one-inch man saved us?
 Rocket: Well, if he got closer, I'm sure he would be much larger.
 Quill: It's how eyesight works, you stupid raccoon.
 Rocket: Don't call me a racoon!
 Quill: I'm sorry. I took it too far. I meant trash panda.
 [Rocket looks around in confusion]
 Rocket: Is that better?
 Drax: I don't know.
 Quill: [snickering] It's worse. It's so much worse.
 Rocket: You son of a…
 Quill: Hey!
 Rocket: I’ve had it with you!
 Quill: No! Back up!
 Nebula: [notices a ship coming through] Someone followed you through the jump point. Set me free, you’ll need my help.
 Gamora: I’m not a fool, Nebula.
 Nebula: You are a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat.
 Gamora: You’ll attack me the moment I let you go.
 Nebula: [terrible at lying] No, I won’t.
 Quill: You’d think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.
 Drax: I bet it’s the one-inch man.
 Ego: After all these years, I’ve found you.
 Peter Quill: And who the hell are you?
 Ego: I figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious. My name is Ego… and I’m your dad, Peter.
 Howard the Duck: You know what they say… "You’re out of luck until you’ve gone duck."
 Tullk: Yondu! Come on down!
 Stakar Ogord: After going around years in circles… with this woman I end up marrying. I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl… "but you’re losing your mind!" Then again, she’s always been that way. I could never trust her. You know?
 Yondu Udonta: Stakar. It’s been some time.
 Stakar: It seems like this establishment is the wrong kind of disreputable.
 Yondu: Stakar!
 Stakar: There’s a hundred Ravager factions. You lost the business of 99 of them by serving one.
 Inn Keeper's Wife: Please, sir. Please!
 Stakar: Get away from me.
 Yondu: You can go to hell then. I don't give a damn what you think of me.
 Stakar: So what are you following us for?"
 Yondu: Are you gonna listen to what I gotta say?!
 Stakar: I don't gotta listen to nothing, you betrayed the code. Ravagers don't deal in kids!
 Yondu: I told you before, I didn't know what was going on...
 Stakar: You didn't know cause you didn't wanna know cause that made you rich.
 Yondu: I demand a seat on the table. I wear these flames, same as you!
 Stakar: You may dress like us, but you'll never hear the hordes of freedom when you die Yondu, and the colors of Ogord will never flash over your grave. If you think I take pleasure in exiling you, you're wrong. You broke all our hearts.
 Taserface: Ah, pathetic. First, Quill betrays us… and Yondu just lets him go scot-free. We followed him because he was the one… who wasn’t afraid to do what needed to be done. Seems he’s goin’ soft.
 Kraglin Obfonteri: If he’s so soft, why are you whispering?
 Taserface: You know I’m right, Kraglin.
 Tullk: You best be very careful what you say about our captain.
 'Ravager: [sees Ayesha] Who the hell is that?
 Ayesha: Yondu Udonta… I have a proposition for you.
 Ego: I hired Yondu to pick you up when your mother passed away. But instead of returning you, Yondu kept you. I have no clue as to why.
 Quill: Well, I’ll tell you why. Because I was a skinny little kid who could squeeze into places adults couldn’t. It made it easier for thievin’.
 Ego: Well, I’ve been trying to track you down ever since.
 Drax: I thought Yondu was your father.
 Quill: What? We’ve been together this whole time… and you thought Yondu was my actual blood relative?
 Drax: You look exactly alike.
 Rocket Raccoon: One’s blue!
 Peter Quill: No, he’s not my father! Yondu was the guy who abducted me, kicked the crap out of me so I could learn to fight, and kept me in terror by threatening to eat me.
 Ego: Eat you?
 Peter Quill: Yeah.
 Ego: Oh, that son of a bitch.
 Gamora: How’d you locate us now?
 Ego: Well, even where I reside, out past the edge of what’s known… we’ve heard tell about the man they call Star-Lord. What say we head out there right now? Your associates are welcome. Even that triangle-faced monkey there. I promise you… it’s unlike any other place you’ve ever seen. And there… I can explain your very special heritage. Finally get to be… the father I’ve always wanted to be. Excuse me. I’ve gotta take a whiz. [goes to the bathroom; Peter looks at Gamora, still not believing his father]
 Quill: I’m not buying it.
 Gamora: Let’s go take a walk.
 Mantis: [smiles; to Drax] I am Mantis.
 Drax: What are you doing?
 Mantis: Smiling. I hear it is the thing to do to make people like you.
 Drax: Not if you do it like that.
 Mantis: Oh… I was raised alone on Ego’s planet. I do not understand the intricacies of social interaction. Can I pet your puppy? It is adorable.
 Drax: Yes. That is called a practical joke!
 Mantis: I liked it very much!
 Drax: I just made it up!
 Quill: Give me a break! After all this time, you’re gonna show up, and all of a sudden you wanna be my dad?
 Gamora: I hear you.
 Quill: And by the way, this could be a trap. The Kree purists, the Ravagers… they all want us dead.
 Gamora:I know, but…
 Quill: But what?
 Gamora: What was that story you once told me about Zardu Hasselfrau?
 Quill: Who?
 Gamora: He owned a magic boat?
 Quill: [long pause] David Hasselhoff?
 Gamora: Right.
 Quill: Not a magic boat. A talking car.
 Gamora: Why did he talk again?
 Quill: To help him fight crime, and to be supportive!
 Gamora: As a child, you would carry his picture in your pocket… and you would tell all the other children… that he was your father, but that he was out of town.
 Quill: Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany. I told you that when I was drunk. Why are you bringing that up now?
 Gamora: I love that story.
 Quill: I hate that story. It’s so sad! As a kid, I used to see all the other kids off playing catch with their dad. And I wanted that, more than anything in the world!
 Gamora: That’s my point, Peter. What if this man is your Hasselhoff? If he ends up being evil… we will just kill him.
 Nebula: You’re leaving me with that fox?
 Gamora: He’s not a fox. Shoot her if she does anything suspicious. Or if you feel like it.
 Rocket: Okay.
 Gamora: [to Groot] It’ll be just a couple of days. We’ll be back before Rocket’s finished fixing the ship. [Groot gives her a sad smile and wave.]
 Drax: What if the Sovereign come?
 Quill: There’s no way for them to know we’re here. Let’s go.
 Drax: I’m uncertain about parting ways.
 Quill: God, you’re like an old woman.
 Drax: Because I’m wise?
 Gamora: Why do you have so much luggage?
 Drax: I don’t want Groot playing with my things.
 Rocket: I hope Daddy isn’t as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.
 Quill: What is your goal here? To get everybody to hate you? Because it’s working.
 [Quill, Gamora and Drax enter Ego's ship, which immediately takes off.]
 Quill: Hey, can I ask you a personal question?
 Mantis: [shocked] Oh… No one has ever asked me a personal question.
 Quill: Your antennas. What are they for?
 Mantis: Their purpose?
 Drax: Yes. Quill and I have a bet.
 Quill: Dude. You're not supposed to say that…
 Drax: I say: if you are about to go through a doorway that is too low, your antennae will feel this, and keep you from being decapitated.
 Quill: Right, and if it's anything other than specifically not being decapitated by a doorway, I win.
 Mantis: They are not for feeling doorways! [Drax groans, Peter laughs] I think they have something to do with my empathic abilities.
 Gamora: What are those?
 Mantis: If I touch someone, I can feel their feelings.
 Quill: You read minds?
 Mantis: No. Telepaths know thoughts. Empaths feel feelings, emotions. May I?
 Quill: Alright.
 Mantis: [touches Quill's hand; as she feels his feelings, her antennas lit up] You feel… love!
 Quill: Yeah, I guess I feel a general, unselfish love for just about everybody around me.
 Mantis: No. Romantic, sexual love…
 Quill: No… no, I don't…
 Mantis: For her! [points at Gamora]
 Quill: No! [Gamora looks surprised] That is not… [Drax suddenly starts laughing uproariously] Okay. [Drax continues laughing and points at Peter as he groans] That's…
 Drax: She just told everyone your deepest, darkest secret!
 Quill: Dude, come on! I think you're overreacting a little bit.
 Drax: You must be so embarrassed!
 [Drax continues cackling as Gamora is in amusement]
 Drax: [to Mantis] Do me! Do me, do me!
 [She reaches over and touches his chest, and immediately starts laughing along with him]
 Mantis: I have never felt such humor!
 [Drax and Mantis are laughing and pointing at Peter]
 Quill: [to himself] So unbelievably uncool.
 Drax: [stops laughing] Oh, Quill…
 [Mantis, who is giggling, walks over to Gamora to touch her]
 Gamora: [suddenly grabs her wrist] Touch me, and the only thing you're gonna feel is a broken jaw. [pause as Mantis looks scared and looks at Gamora, before she finally lets go of Mantis' wrist]
 Mantis: I can… also alter emotions to some extent.
 Peter Quill: Yeah, like what?
 Mantis: If I touch someone who is sad, I can ease them into contentment for a short while. I can make a stubborn person compliant. But I mostly use it to help my master sleep. He lies awake at night, thinking about his progeny.
 Drax: …Do one of those on me! [Mantis puts her hand on Drax's head]
 Mantis: Sleep. [Suddenly, Drax immediately falls asleep and snores loudly]
 [Scene changes to Rocket on Berhert]
 Rocket: I love this song.
 Ravager: Ain’t so tough now without all your toys… are you?
 Rocket: Crap.
 Yondu: Hey there, rat!
 Rocket: How's it goin', you blue idiot?
 Yondu: Not so bad! We got ourselves a pretty good little gig here! This golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself has offered us a large sum to deliver you and your pals over to her, because she wants to kill y'all.
 [All the Ravagers laugh; back to the destroyed Milano]
 Nebula: [to Baby Groot] Your friend… There's too many of them. He needs my help. If you care about him… You need to get me out of these bonds. They are going to kill him!
 Yondu: [to Rocket] I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you. I put a tracer on your ship back there… during the war over Xandar.
 Rocket: Give me your word you won't hurt Groot, and I'll tell you where the batteries are.
 Yondu: [chuckles a little] Lucky for you, my word don't mean squat. Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.
 Taserface: Otherwise, you'd what?
 Yondu We'll take them batteries! They’re worth what? A quarter mill on the open market?
 Taserface: That Priestess offered us a million! A quarter is only… one-third of that!
 Yondu: A quarter ain't a third…
 Gef: A quarter is 25. [Yondu shakes his head]
 Yondu: No.
 Gef: We can't even buy a pair of boots with 25 units.
 Yondu: Enough! The point is, we ain't stupid enough to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy! The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.
 Kraglin: [off-screen] That ain't right! I just gotta say it this one time, Cap'n… No matter how many times Quill betrays you, you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!
 Ravagers: Yeah!!
 Kraglin: I'm the one what sticks up for you!
 Tullk: Take it easy, Kraglin.
 Taserface: Damn straight, lad! He's gone soft. Suppose it’s time for a change in leadership!
 [All the Ravagers start agreeing as they cock their guns at each other and Yondu prepares to whistle his Yaka arrow; the Ravagers continue to yell and holding their weapons at each other]
 Tullk: Put your damn guns down!!
 Rocket: Whoa! Whoa. There must be some kind of peaceful resolution to this, fellas… or even a violent one where I'm standing over there.
 [Suddenly, a blast destroys Yondu's control fin, knocking him unconscious, and we see Nebula behind them.]
 Nebula: Well, hello boys. [takes a bite of the root she's holding; spits it out] It’s not ripe.
 [George Harrison's "My Sweet Lord" plays, as the three Guardians, Ego and Mantis leave the ship, and we see the psychedelic landscape of Ego's planet.]
 Ego: Welcome, everyone, to my world.
 Quill: Wow. You have your own planet?
 Ego: Come on. No larger than your Earth’s Moon.
 Drax: Humility. I like it. I, too, am extraordinarily humble.
 Gamora: You own a planet and can destroy two dozen spaceships without a suit. What are you exactly?
 Ego: I’m what’s called a Celestial, sweetheart.
 Quill: A Celestial, like a god?
 Ego: Mmm, small "g," son. At least on the days I’m feeling humble as Drax. I don’t know where I came from exactly. First thing I remember is flickering… adrift in the cosmos utterly… and entirely alone. Over millions of years… I learned to control the molecules around me. I grew smarter and stronger. And I continued building from there… layer by layer… the very planet you walk on now. But I wanted more. I desired… meaning. "There must be some life out there in the universe… besides just me," I thought. And so, I set myself the task of finding it. I created… what I imagined biological life to be like… down to the most minute detail.
 Drax: Did you make a penis?
 Quill: Dude!
 Gamora: What is wrong with you?
 Drax: If he is a planet, how could he make a baby with your mother? He would smush her!
 Quill: I don’t need to hear how my parents…
 Drax: Why? My father would tell the story of impregnating my mother every winter solstice.
 Quill: That’s disgusting.
 Drax: It was beautiful. You Earthers have hang-ups.
 Ego: Yes, Drax, I got a penis.
 Drax: Ha! Thank you!
 Ego: It’s not half bad.
 Drax: Oh.
 Quill: - Ugh.
 Ego: I’ve also got pain receptors, and a digestive system… and all the accompanying junk. I wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human… as I set out amongst the stars… until I found… what I sought. Life. I was not alone in the universe after all.
 Quill: When did you meet my mother?
 Ego: Not long after. It was with Meredith that I first experienced love. I called her my river lily. And from that love, Peter… you. I have searched for you for so long. And when I heard of a man from Earth… who held an Infinity Stone in his hand without dying… I knew you must be the son of the woman I loved.
 Peter Quill: If you loved her, why did you leave her?
 [Scene changes to the Ravagers' ship.]
 Tullk: This is mutiny! This is mutiny!
 Oblo: Captain! Help me! Please! Captain!
 Taserface: You're the one what killed those men… by leading them down the wrong path. Because you're weak. And stupid! It's time for the Ravagers… to rise once again to glory with a new captain… Taserface!
 Rocket: I'm sorry. Your name is… It's Taserface?
 Taserface: That's right.
 Rocket: Do you shoot tasers out of your face?
 Taserface: It's metaphorical!
 Rocket: For what?
 Taserface: For it is a name what strikes fear… into the hearts of anyone what hears it.
 Rocket: Okay… whatever you say.
 Taserface: You shut up. You're next. Udonta, I have waited a long time to do… What?
 Rocket: I'm sorry. I am so sorry! I just keep imagining you waking up in the morning, sir… looking in the mirror and then in all seriousness saying to yourself… "You know what would be a really kick-ass name? "Taserface!" That’s how I hear you in my head! What was your second choice? Scrotum Hat?
 Taserface: New plan. We're killing you first.
 Rocket: Well, dying is certainly better than having to live an entire life… as a moronic shitbag who thinks Taserface is a cool name.
 Nebula: That’s enough killing for today.
 Ravager: She's the daughter of Thanos.
 Taserface: I thought you were the biggest sadist in the galaxy.
 Nebula: That was when Daddy was paying my bills. The Priestess wants to kill the fox herself. And he has bounties on his head in at least 12 Kree provinces. I assure you… I am not as easy a mark as an old man without his magic stick… or a talking woodland beast. I want 10% of the take… and a couple more things.
 Kraglin: We got a whole box of hands… if that one don’t work out.
 Nebula: It is fine.
 Kraglin: You think them Kree is gonna execute the captain?
 Nebula: The Kree consider themselves merciful. It will be painless.
 Kraglin: Well, here it is. It’s the best ship we got. Location of Ego’s planet in the nav. We’ll wire you the 10% once we’s paid. What are you gonna do with your share?
 Nebula:  As a child, my father would have Gamora and me battle one another in training. Every time my sister prevailed… my father would replace a piece of me with machinery… claiming he wanted me to be her equal. But she won… again and again, and again, never once refraining. So after I murder my sister… I will buy a warship with every conceivable instrument of death. I will hunt my father like a dog, and I will tear him apart slowly… piece by piece… until he knows some semblance of the profound and unceasing pain… I know every single day.
 Kraglin: Yeah. I was talking about, like, a pretty necklace. Or a nice hat. Something to make the other girls go, "Ooh, that’s nice!" Anyways, happy trails.
 [Scene changes to Ego's planet]
 Quill: My mother told everyone my father was from the stars. She had brain cancer, so everyone thought she was delusional.
 Ego: Peter…
 Quill: Listen, I’d love to believe all of this, I really would. But you left… the most wonderful woman ever… to die alone.
 Ego: I didn’t want to leave your mother, Peter. If I don’t return regularly to my planet… and the light within it… this form will wither and perish.
 Quill: So why didn’t you come back? Why did you send Yondu? A criminal, of all people, to come and fetch me?
 Ego: I loved your mother, Peter! I couldn’t stand to set foot on an Earth… where she wasn’t living! You can’t imagine what that’s like!
 Quill: I know exactly what that feels like! I had to watch her die!
 Ego: Over the millions and millions of years of my existence… I’ve made many mistakes, Peter. But you’re not one of them. Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be. There’s so much that I need to teach you about this planet… and the light within. They are a part of you, Peter.
 Quill: What do you mean?
 Ego: Give me your hands, son. Here. Hold them like that. Now, close your eyes and concentrate. Take your brain to the center of this planet. Yes!
 Quill: Whoa!
 Ego: Yes! It’s okay. Just relax. Concentrate. You can do it. Bring it back. Yes! Yes, now shape it. Feel that energy. Yes. You’re home. Peter…
 Drax: How did you get to this weird, dumb planet?
 Mantis: Ego found me in my larva state. Orphaned on my homeworld. He raised me by hand, and kept me as his own.
 Drax: So you’re a pet?
 Mantis: I suppose.
 Drax: People usually want cute pets. Why would Ego want such a hideous one?
 Mantis: I am hideous?
 Drax: You are horrifying to look at. Yes. But that’s a good thing.
 Mantis: Oh?
 Drax: When you’re ugly, and someone loves you… you know they love you for who you are. Beautiful people never know who to trust.
 Mantis: Well, then I’m certainly grateful to be ugly.
 Drax: Those pools, they remind me of a time… when I took my daughter to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld. She was like you.
 Mantis: Disgusting?
 Drax: Innocent.
 Mantis: Drax? There’s something I must tell you. [Before she can tell him, Gamora walks through the doors with a suspicious look on her face.]
 Gamora: What’s going on?
 Drax: This gross bug lady is my new friend.
 Mantis: I’m learning many things, like I’m a pet and ugly.
 Gamora: You’re not ugly. Drax!
 Drax: What are you talking about?
 Gamora: [to Mantis] Mantis… can you show us where we’ll be staying? Why are there no other beings on this planet?
 Mantis: The planet is Ego. A dog would not invite a flea to live on his back.
 Gamora: And you’re not a flea?
 Mantis: I’m a flea with a purpose. I help him sleep.
 Gamora: What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?
 Mantis: Nothing. Your quarters are this way.
 Taserface: We deliver you to the Kree in the morning. Neither one of you will last much longer after that.
 Rocket: Okay, Taserface. Hey, tell the other guys we said… "Hi," Taserface!
 (SIGHS)
 Gef: What about this little plant? Can I smash it with a rock?
 Taserface: No, Gef. It’s too adorable to kill. Take it to the tailor.
 Rocket: No offense, but your employees are a bunch of jerks.
 Yondu: I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years when Stakar freed me. He offered me a place with the Ravagers. He said all I needed to do was adhere to the code. But I was young… and greedy, and stupid. Like you stealing those batteries.
 Rocket: That was mostly Drax.
 Yondu: Me and Stakar and the other captains… we weren’t so different from you and your friends. The only family I ever had. When I broke the code… they exiled me. This is what I deserve.
 Rocket: Slow down, drama queen. You might deserve this, but I don’t. We gotta get outta here.
 Yondu: Where’s Quill?
 Rocket: He went off with his old man.
 Yondu: Ego?
 Rocket: Yeah. It’s a day for dumbass names. (CHUCKLES) You’re smiling. And for a second, I got a warm feeling. But then it was ruined by those disgusting-ass teeth.
 Yondu: You like a professional asshole or what?
 Rocket: Pretty much a pro. Why didn’t you deliver Quill to Ego like you promised?
 Yondu: He was skinny. Could fit into places we couldn’t. Good for thievin’.
 Rocket: Uh-huh.
 Yondu: I got an idea on how to get outta here. But we’re gonna need your little friend.
 ALL: (CHANTING) Mascot, mascot, mascot…

 (LAUGHTER CONTINUES)
 Yondu: Psst! Hey, twig! Come here. Come on.
 Rocket: Aw, man… what did they do to you?
 Yondu: Hey, you wanna help us get outta here? There’s something I need you to get, and bring back to me. In the captain’s quarters, there’s a prototype fin… the thing I wore on my head. There’s a drawer next to the bunk. It’s in that. It’s red. You got it?
 (RAVAGERS SNORING)
 (GROOT COMES BACK WITH UNDERWEAR)
 Yondu: That’s my underwears.
 Rocket: Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn’t know what you were talkin’ about. You have to explain it more careful.
 Yondu: It’s a prototype fin.
 (SCREECHING)
 Rocket: That’s an orloni. It’s a fin, Groot.
 Yondu: You explain it this time.
 Rocket: All right.
 Yondu: That’s Vorker’s eye. He takes it out when he sleeps. Go. Look again.
 Rocket: But leave the eye here.
 Yondu: Why?
 Rocket: He’s gonna wake up tomorrow… and he’s not gonna know… where his eye is! (LAUGHING)
 Rocket: That's a desk. We told you it was this big.
 (GROOT RETURNS WITH A TOE)
 Rocket: Tell me you guys have a refrigerator somewhere… with a bunch of severed human toes. (YONDU SHAKES HIS HEAD NO) Okay. Then let’s just agree to never discuss this.
 Yondu: The drawer you wanna open has this symbol on it. Okay?
 (GROOT HOLDS COIN OVER HEAD)
 Yondu: What? No!
 Rocket: He thinks you want him to wear it as a hat.
 Yondu: That’s not what I said!
 Groot: I am Groot.
 Rocket: He’s relieved you don’t want him to.
 Groot: I am Groot.
 Rocket: He hates hats.
 Groot: I am Groot.
 Rocket: On anyone, not just himself.
 Groot: I am Groot.
 Rocket: One minute you think someone has a weird-shaped head… the next minute it’s just because you realize part of that head is the hat. That’s why you don’t like hats?
 Yondu: This is an important conversation right now?
 (SNORING)
 (BURPS)
 Kraglin: That ain’t it. I didn’t mean to do a mutiny. They killed all my friends.
 Yondu: Get the third quadrant ready for release.
 Rocket: One more thing. You got any clones of Quill’s old music on the ship?

 Quill: So I guess this could all be mine someday.
 Gamora: Rocket? Rocket, are you there?
 (SIGHS)
 Gamora: What are you doing, Peter?
 Quill: Dance with me.
 Gamora: I’m not going to dance with you.
 Quill: This is Sam Cooke… one of the greatest Earth singers of all time.
 (MUSIC CONTINUES)
 Quill: Drax thinks you’re not a dancer.
 Gamora: If you ever tell anyone about this… I will kill you.
 Quill: When are we gonna do something about this unspoken thing between us?
 Gamora: What unspoken thing?
 Quill: This… Cheers, Sam and Diane… a guy and a girl on a TV show who dig each other… but never say it because if they do, the ratings would go down… sort of thing.
 Gamora: There’s no unspoken thing.
 Quill: Well, it’s a catch-22, because if you said it, then it would be spoken… and you would be a liar. So, by not saying it… you are telling the truth, and admitting that there is.
 Gamora: No, that’s not what I…
 (SIGHS)
 Gamora: What we should be discussing right now is something about this place. It doesn’t feel right.
 Quill: What are you talking about? You’re the one who wanted me to come here!
 Gamora: That girl Mantis… she’s afraid of something.
 Quill: Why are you trying to take this away from me?
 Gamora: I’m not trying…
 Quil: He’s my father. He’s blood.
 Gamora: You have blood on Earth and you never wanted to return there.
 Quill: Again, you made me come here! And Earth is the place where my mother died in front of me.
 Gamora: No, it’s because that place is real, and this is a fantasy.
 Quill: This is real! I’m only half-human, remember?
 Gamora: That’s the half I’m worried about.
 Quill: Oh, I get it. You’re jealous… because I’m part-god, and you like when I’m the weak one.
 Gamora: You were insufferable to begin with. I haven’t been able to reach Rocket. I’m gonna go outside, and I’m gonna try and get a signal.
 Quill: You know what? This is not Cheers after all! This is whatever the show is where one person is willing… to open themselves up to new possibility, and the other person is a jerk… who doesn’t trust anybody!
 Gamora: It’s a show that doesn’t exist.
 Quill: That’s why it would get zero ratings!
 Gamora: I don’t know what Cheers is!
 Quill: I finally found my family. Don’t you understand that?

 (LOOKING GLASS’ "BRANDY (YOU’RE A FINE GIRL)" PLAYING)
 Ego: You all right, son? I saw your girl stomp off a little earlier in quite a huff.
 Quill: Yeah. (SIGHS)
 Ego: It’s fortuitous… you listening to this song.
 Quill: You know…
 Quill: Brandy? By Looking Glass?
 Ego: (CHUCKLES) A favorite of your mom’s.
 Quill: Yeah, it was.
 Ego: One of Earth’s greatest musical compositions. Perhaps its very greatest.
 Quill: Yes!
 Ego: Peter, you and I, we’re the sailor in that song.
 He came on a summer’s day. Bringing gifts from far away.
 Ego: Like the child I put in your mother… or the freedom you brought Gamora.
 Brandy, you’re a fine girl.
 What a good wife you would be.
 My life, my love.
 My lady is the sea.
 The sea calls the sailor back.
 He loves the girl, but that’s not his place.
 The sea calls upon him as history calls upon great men.
 Ego: And sometimes we are deprived the pleasures of mortals.
 Quill: Well, you may not be mortal, but me…
 Ego: No, Peter… death will remain a stranger to both of us… as long as the light burns within the planet.
 Quill: I’m immortal?
 Ego: Mmm-hmm.
 Quill: Really?
 Ego: Yes! As long as the light exists. And I can use the light to build cool things… like how you made this whole planet? It might take you a few million years of practice… before you get really good at it. But, yes!
 Quill: What! Get ready for an 800-foot statue of Pac-Man with Skeletor… and Heather Locklear.
 Ego: You can do anything you want.
 Quill: I’m gonna make some weird shit.
 Ego: But you know, Peter, it is a tremendous responsibility. Only we can remake the universe. Only we can take the bridle of the cosmos… and lead it to where it needs to go.
 Quill: How?
 Ego: Come with me.

 (RETCHING)
 Mantis: What are you doing?
 Drax: I’m imagining being with you physically.
 Mantis: Drax… I don’t like you like that. I don’t even like the type of thing you are.
 Drax: Hey! There’s no need to get personal.
 Mantis: Listen! Ego’s gotten exactly what he wanted. I should have told you earlier. I’m stupid. You are in danger.
 (BOTH PANTING)
 Quill: What is that?
 Ego: Now, you need to readjust the way you process life. Everything around us, including the girl… Everything is temporary. We are forever.
 Quill: Doesn’t eternity get boring?
 Ego: Not if you have a purpose, Peter… which is why you’re here. I told you how all those years ago… I had an unceasing impulse to find life. But what I did not tell you was how, when I finally did find it… it was all so… disappointing. And that is when I came… to a profound realization. My innate desire to seek out other life… was not so that I could walk among that life. Peter… I have found meaning.
