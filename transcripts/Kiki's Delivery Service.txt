But, first, here's the weather forecast. Skies are clearing up, thanks to a high-pressure front moving in from the mountains. Mild winds will be blowing in from the west, pushing the clouds out by this evening. There'll be a beautiful full moon lighting up the sky, so if you have been planning something special, tonight might be the night. Tomorrow also looks good with clear skies and sun. Jiji, wake up. Tonight's the night. Hey, Mom. Hi, Miss Dora. Hey, Mom, it's gonna be clear tonight. And guess what? The radio says there'll be a full moon. Did you borrow your father's radio again without asking? Don't worry. He doesn't mind. Please excuse me, Miss Dora. Mom, it's a perfect midnight for me to leave home. You mean tonight? Next month is what you told me. Yeah. But the next full moon might be on a cloudy night. And I want to leave on the perfect midnight. Huh? But, Kiki... Wait. My, oh, my. What's this all about? It's one of our oldest customs that when a witch turns 13, she has to leave home for a year to begin her training. Your little baby is 13? My goodness, but time flies so quickly. I know. She seems so young to be leaving home now. I remember very well the exact day you arrived in this town. A little girl flew down from the sky on her broomstick. And I was certain she was much too young to hold such an important job as resident witch. Yes, but I could fly. Kiki barely knows how to do that. And I have had no time to teach her how to mix potions like me. Hmm. Young people are all the same. They all want to do something different. But I hope you at least get to teach her the potion that cures my rheumatism. Hurry up! We always said we'd leave on the perfect night. Didn't we? Uh-uh. Our plan was that we would stick around for another month and play it safe. I like that plan. And if we put it off for a month, and I find some wonderful boyfriend, then what'll we do? Come on, Jiji. I'm gonna put my paws together and pray you're not serious. Of course I am. You know, ever since I turned 13, I've been excited about making this trip. There. Dad. Dad. Guess what? I've decided to leave tonight. - You're going away? - Yeah. There's a full moon. Well, yeah, but what happened to the camping trip we were supposed to take this weekend? Sorry, Dad. Uh! Kiki, Wait. Yeah, I'll expect you then. Thanks. Hi, Mom, it's me. I wanted to make sure you knew that Kiki is leaving tonight. Yes, midnight. Very pretty. Lilac would look prettier on me, or white. Witches have worn this color for a very long time, Kiki. Oh, Mom. I look really dumb. It's not really important what color your dress is. What matters is the heart inside. Well, I'm gonna be the very best witch that I can be, Mom. And I know having a good heart is important. Just follow your heart and keep smiling. Yeah. And be sure to write home as soon as you're settled. Okay. Dad. Oh, can I please take the radio? Mom, didn't you say I could have the radio? Yay! - All right. It's yours already. - Thank you. Well, now, you certainly look very grown-up, my little princess. Ta-da! You look just like your mother when she was young. I'm glad about that. Dad, can you lift me up high, like when I was little? Well... I don't know. Here we go! How come you never told me you were growing up so fast? If things don't work out, you can always come home. And come back a failure? Will you write us if you have the time? Mmm-hmm. After all, she is a baby. Aren't you worried about Kiki living in a big city all alone?   Of course, they are. But Kiki will be just fine. - You're gonna find a city by the ocean? - Or maybe a town? Uh-huh. That's what I'm hoping anyway. Wow! You're gonna have such a good time. I'm so jealous. You'll have so much fun. But I'm not going just for a good time. In order to be a good witch, I have to train a year away from home. Yeah. Be sure to tell that to the boys. Kiki, it's time. Okay. That's the broom you're going to be leaving on? Yup. I just made it this morning all by myself. Honey, it's too small to be really safe. I'd rather you took my broom. I know it better. - But, Mom, that one's so old. - And that's why it's good. You can rely on it time after time in any kind of weather. Now, Kiki, do this for me, please. But I put so much work into this one. Right, Jiji? Your broom is nice, but let's take your mother's. You're no help. Now, Kiki, can't you make yourself another fine broom when you get settled down? Mmm-hmm. Be careful. - You be strong. Okay? - I will. Bye, Kiki. - Fly safely. - Go get 'em! Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go! Aim your broomstick. May our little baby be well and have a safe trip. I'm going to miss the wonderful sound of those bells. Mmm-hmm. - Where are we going? - I'm headed south to see the ocean. Jiji, climb up and turn on the radio. I don't think I can handle it. Can you do it? Hey. Good evening. It was. You're new, aren't you? Yup! How'd you guess? I just left home tonight. Mmm-hmm. Would you mind turning off that radio? - I prefer to fly without being distracted. - Oh. Yeah, sure. Could you tell me? Is it really hard to get settled into a brand new city? Oh, yes. A lot can go wrong. But since my skill is fortune-telling,  I can handle anything. - Fortune-telling? - Yes. I tell fortunes about love. Wow! And what exactly is your skill? Um. Well, I haven't really decided that yet. Ah. Well, I'm nearly finished with my training period. I'm going home soon to show off my new skills. - That's my town down there. - It's so big! Yes, to you I'm sure it looks big. - I hope you don't have too tough a time. - Thanks. Ciao! Jeez, what a snob. And did you see that cat? What's my skill? What are we gonna do? We can't stay up! Hold on! We better rest here until it's dry. - Won't we get in trouble? - Not if nobody finds us. I'm soaked through down to the bone. Hello? Mmm. This smells great. Oops! Sorry. We didn't mean to fall asleep in your breakfast. Wow! Jiji, you've gotta come see the ocean. It's beautiful. Big deal. It's just a big puddle of water. Look. Up ahead. How lovely. - I wonder if they have a witch there. - Oh, great. Ready, set, go! Hold on. You okay back there? Wow! This is just the kind of place I've always imagined. Wow! A clock tower. Look at this city. A place like this would be great to live in. But there may be some witches living here already. And there may not be. Look at how many people there are. Too many, if you ask me. Bless my hourglass. It's a real, live witch. Good morning. - Do any witches live in this town? - Why... Nobody's seen one around here in a long time. That's great. Our trip is over. We're staying right here. - Thanks, mister. Bye. - No problem. - Tell me we're not landing down there. - Well, of course, we are. - They're looking at us. - I know. Smile, so we make a good impression. Um. Hi. My name's Kiki, and I'm a witch. And this is Jiji. He's my black cat. And we'd be honored  if we could live here. Your city is so amazing. And what a beautiful clock tower. Really. That's very nice, dear. Bye. Uh... Hey, you, kid. Who do you think you are, jumping out into the street like that? You were almost responsible for a big accident, zooming around on your broom back there. But I'm a new witch, sir. We're supposed to fly around. You're supposed to obey the law. I'm gonna have to write you up. Now give me your name and address. Will you tell my parents? Of course, I'm going to tell your parents. - I have to do that with every minor. - Thief! Thief! - Huh? - Somebody call the cops. - He's getting away! - Now you stay right there. Uh, Kiki? Miss. Wait up. I sure fooled that cop, huh? Hey, that was me yelling "thief." You'll be okay now. Worked out pretty good, huh? You gotta be a real witch, the way you can fly that broom. Do you think maybe you can teach me how to fly it? Hey, Tombo. Maybe you can sweep her off her feet with that broom. Hey, shut up, all right? You know, miss, I love flying, too. Can I see your broom? Hey, wait! Thank you for getting me out of trouble. But I really shouldn't be talking to you, and you wanna know why? It's very rude to talk to a girl before you've been introduced and before you know her name. Hmph! Uh... Hmm. You're kind of old-fashioned, aren't you? - You sound like my grandmother. - Just go away and leave me alone! Hey! Don't go. Hmm. What a cool witch. Stay here tonight? I'm afraid I don't understand. Your parents are here with you, aren't they? No, sir, I'm alone. I've come to this town because I'm a new witch in training. Do you have some identification? Oh, never mind. - Kiki, aren't you going to eat that? - No, you can have it, Jiji. Where are we going to stay tonight?  Let's go. Why don't we go find another town? I'll bet there are bigger and better ones. Ones that are friendlier than this. Oh, dear. Oh, my goodness. Hey, there! Your pacifier! Ma'am, you forgot your baby's pacifier. Oh, poor baby. Without this, the baby'll wake up and cry all the way home. I better go give it to her myself. I'm sorry, folks. But could you wait just a minute? I'll be right back. Excuse me. But would you like me to deliver it for you? What? The woman with the baby carriage who just went around the corner. - I could reach her in no time. - Really? You'd do that? - Thank you so much. - My pleasure. Let's go, Jiji. Wow! Sorry to surprise you, but the lady in the bakery asked me to return this pacifier. - Here you go. - Okay, I'd like one of those. Yes, sir. Oh, hi, there. Come in and wait a minute, will you? Mmm. These are nice and fresh. Just out of the oven. There you are. Here you go. See you tomorrow. Bye. And that'll be all for you? All right. Thank you. Now, come back again. When I saw you fly off, I thought for a second I was dreaming. The baby's mother told me to give you this message. Hmm? "Thanks for returning the pacifier. "Your new delivery girl is really quite special." - Well, I'll be on my way. - Wait. Wait a minute. I really must do something to show you my thanks. Follow me. Bakery is downstairs. Upstairs is home. Sit down and relax. Would you like some hot chocolate? Okay. - There you go. - Thank you very much, ma'am. And, this is for you, little guy. So tell me if I'm right. I'm guessing you're a witch in training. I really love it here. But people don't seem to like witches in this town. Depends on the people. Now, take me, for instance. I just met you and I know I like you.  So, tell me, whereabouts are you two staying? - Uh... - Oh, I see. Why didn't you tell me you have no place to stay? We have a spare room in the attic. You can use that. You'd really let me stay with you? Why, of course. But we haven't introduced ourselves. - My name's Osono. - And I'm Kiki, ma'am. And Jiji here is my very best friend. It's right up here, Kiki. It may need a little dusting, but I think you'll like it. Oh, my! It's a little bit dustier than I remember. If I weren't about to have a baby, I'd help you clean. - That's okay. - All right, then. Water and bathroom are downstairs. Give a shout if you need anything. Thank you. - This is quaint. - Jiji. Hmph! If you wake up tomorrow and find a white cat, it's me. Jiji, we can see the ocean from here. Can we look for a new town? Pardon me, Miss Snooty Cat. And the excitement is building for the moment when the big blimp appears in our skies. And so we're gonna go to Scott, live, as he reports in from... Jiji, I've decided not to leave this town. Maybe I can stay and find some other nice people like Osono who will like me and accept me for who I am. ...and the ship making some kind of landing just so that everyone can get a closer look. And the amazing thing is there's never been a dirigible this large and this safe before. How much do you think it would cost to get a phone here? - A phone? - Yup. We're gonna need a phone. - Morning, everyone. - Well, look who's up. - Did you sleep well? - Yes. Oh, that smells good. - Can I help out? - Sure can. Ooh, a delivery business, huh? Well, I really only have one skill, and that's flying. So I thought a delivery service wouldn't be a bad idea. It's a great idea. Kiki's Flying Delivery Service.  And since you're staying right here, I can be your very first account. You mean it? Oh, that's great. I was planning on putting a phone upstairs. - But a phone is so expensive. - I have a little saved up already. Don't waste your money. What I think you should do is use our phone. You know, it will take some time to get regular customers. I'll make you a deal. Since I'm expecting a baby, I could use help. If you mind the store once in a while, I'll let you have the room and the phone. And I'll throw in a free breakfast, okay? Yeah! We've got a deal. I'm gonna work very hard for you. Osono, you're the greatest. Hmm? Jiji, come on. I'm all through. We're gonna go shopping. Come on. Kiki, in the city, you can't just run out into the street. I'm sorry. We're still alive, aren't we? You know how boys are. He's so cute. I hope he's still invited to her birthday party. - Don't you? - Yeah. I wish I had something pretty to wear. My dress is so ugly. Wow! This costs so much. Kiki, look. It's me. Any money left, Kiki? Not much. Looks like all we can afford to eat now is pancakes. Look, Jiji. Aren't they beautiful? Hey. Pull over. Hey, there. Miss Witch, do you remember me? How come you're not flying today? It's me, you remember? Tombo. You can tell she's a witch 'cause she always wears a dark dress. Hey, wait. Come back, please. I didn't mean to insult you. - Yeah. - Better luck next time, Tombo. Oh, Kiki, perfect timing. There's a lady here who wants you to make a delivery. - She's your first customer. - Customer? Oh, my! I'll be right back. Dear, this lady is a customer of ours, and we were talking about your new delivery service. - What a charming girl. - My name's Kiki, ma'am. Osono's told me great things about you.  Do you think you can deliver this by tonight? Yeah. I can. It's a birthday gift for my nephew. But something came up at work, and I can't make it to the party on time. I can get it there for you, guaranteed. Show me on the map where you want it delivered. Huh? But that's me. Are you sure it won't be too far? - I can fly there straight from here. - Great. How much will it cost? Oh! Well, I haven't really thought about a price. Aha! How about this much then? I hope it'll be enough. What do you think? This much for me? That's great. Thank you. Yeah. I got to see this. - She's the most amazing girl. - She sure is. Hey, what can you tell me about her? Kiki, how high do you intend to go? This is my first job, and I do not want to be stopped by that traffic cop. Well, don't look now, but that's an airplane flying under us. Now, let's see. Yup. It's just past the cape. - Here we go. - Whoa, boy. I'm getting to like this town more and more. I'm getting sick to my stomach. I can't wait to write Mom and Dad about my new business. Look who's behind us. Wild geese. And they're coming with us. Hi. - They seem awfully upset. - They say they're going to fly higher. - Huh? - They say a gust of wind's coming. Oh. Oh! A nest! Oh, I'm sorry. Leave me alone. I wasn't trying to steal your eggs. Really. Oh, my goodness. Well, it's your fault. The geese were kind enough to warn us of that wind. - But would you listen? - Oh, be quiet. Look at them. Up so high. That gust of wind took them all the way up. Kiki, we've got a problem. The toy fell out. We've gotta go back. They're calling you an egg stealer. If I were you, I wouldn't go back down there, again. We have to. Hold on! Hey. Stop that. Go away. Leave us alone. Stop it.  - Maybe we better rethink our plan. - Frankly, I think this is a major insult. Crows used to serve witches and do what you told them. That was a long time ago, okay? How about if we go in after dark? Go in. Get it. Get out. We won't be able to make it in time. Unless we buy ourselves some time. You gotta be kidding. You can just pretend to be the doll until I find the real one. Don't worry. Hold still. - Can I breathe? - No, no breathing. It must be my present from aunty. Yeah. Give it to me. This is dumb. You're a bit late. After my sister telephoned, we were wondering where you were. Uh, I'm sorry. Um... Could I please have your signature, ma'am? Mom, can I put the canary in here? Uh-huh. But you be sure not to let it fly away, Ket. Okay. I've gotta run. Bye! Thank you. Enjoy your present. Come on, you stupid bird. I got a brand-new home for you. Please hurry, Kiki. I know you fell close by, so you've got to be here somewhere. There you are. Hello. Anyone home? Is anybody here? Anybody? Hello. - Anybody here? - Yes. Stop shouting. I'm on the roof. What do you want? Why don't you come up? What do you want? Oh, well, you have a black cat in your cabin window, and, you see, it's mine and I need it back. You're a good birdie, aren't you? So, why was it alone in the forest, huh? That's where I dropped it. Um. May I have it back, please? I really need to finish this. That's my girl. You're just about through, okay? Well, why didn't you tell me sooner why you needed it in such a hurry? He keeps me company. I've gotten sort of fond of him, you know? Thank you. Oh! Oh, no! His head's falling off. Ooh, it must have been the crows. They were making such a big fuss over him. This is terrible. I can't  deliver it like this. Hmm. Hey! I know. How about we work out a deal? So you're on your own at 13. That's pretty exciting. To be completely independent and a witch. Impressive. - How's it going? - Trust me. He'll be good as new. Almost done. Ket, dear. Turn Off the TV. Your birthday guests are gonna be here soon. Ket. Did you hear me? - Ket, turn off the TV! - Okay, okay. - I'm done. - Thank you very much. - Better go get Jiji before it's too late. - But I haven't finished yet. Don't worry. You've done enough. Now, go on and get him. Thanks. Jeff likes my present more than me. Jeff's such a funny dog. He simply adores that stuffed cat. He won't leave it alone. I'll bet he thinks it's a puppy. He'll be upset when Ket wants to take it and play with it. - He sure will. He sure will. - That's okay. Just don't forget to send your aunt a thank-you note. - Okay. Okay. - Ket. Well, I'm glad to see Jeff excited about something. He's getting to be such an old dog. - Yeah. All he does is sleep all day. - All day. Ket, dear, go open the door. Jeff wants to go out. Jeff, shut the door when you're done. Okay? - There you are. - What took you so long? - I'm sorry. - Jeff helped me escape. Kiki, if we ask him, I bet he'll take the stuffed one back inside. He'll do it. He's a good dog. Could you take this in, please? - How are you? Hungry? - No, I'm tired. Yeah, me, too. I'm very tired. We're both gonna sleep well tonight. By the way, that painter who found the stuffed cat told me she wants to do a drawing with me in it. - Naked? - Jiji. Boring. Wake up. You're supposed to be minding the store. I am, but today this place is boring. But it always gets busy about this time. I know that. That's not what I mean. I mean, my customers.  Jiji, if nobody comes in, I'm gonna have to eat pancakes forever and be fat, fat, fat. And what am I supposed to do about that? Well, I like pancakes, provided they're not burned. Look, fur ball, when you get as fat and round as a pancake, you see if I care. Beautiful, isn't she? They tell me she's a clothes designer. Her designs may be fabulous, but her cat's still a snob. Hello. Good Cooking Pan Bakery. What? Pardon? Uh, yes, ma'am. About time we got a customer, huh? Yes, ma'am, 4:30 will be a perfect time to pick it up. If you'll just... And the address? Yes. The blue roof. Right. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I have it all. And thank you very much, ma'am. Hi. I'll take this, please. Okay? Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Oh, come on. You're not still mad at me, are you? Listen, we're gonna have a huge party at the club tonight. It's called the Aviation Club, and we'd really like for you to come. Here's your invitation. It's a serious club for kids who are into flying and aircraft and stuff. And, you know, everybody'd be really excited if you came. Yes. May I help you, sir? They tell me you have a delivery service. Uh, oh. I'm sorry. Yes, of course, we can handle it. It's very urgent this package arrive as soon as possible. That's no problem. Are you all right? - I do this every day. - Can I help you? Well, I hope you make up your mind by 6:00. 'Cause that's when I'll be by to pick you up. - See ya. - How much will that be? Will that be inside or outside city limits, sir? - I wrote the address on the box. - Oh! Oh, the box. Oh, I'm sorry. Osono! Osono! I've got a big problem. I got an invitation to go to a party at Tombo's flying club. I'm sure it'll be a great party, Kiki. No. But my problem is,  what am I going to wear? Kiki, you haven't got a problem. You look fine in that. Besides, it makes you look beautiful and mysterious. - Really? - How's work? I almost forgot about that. It's already 4:00. Oh, no. Can you watch the store until I get back, Osono? Jiji? Jiji? You were so mad at that boy. I don't understand why you're going to his party. Please don't talk. I'm trying to fly this broom, okay? Thank you very much. Bye. Come on, Jiji. We can't keep our next appointment waiting. There's the blue roof. Here we are. My name's Kiki, and someone telephoned for a delivery service, so here I am. Right this way, dear. - You are right on time. - Thank you. Oh, madam, the delivery girl is here. My, delivery time already? Come in, dear. Please make yourself right at home. - Please do. - Thanks. May I take that for you? Thank you. Broom and a black cat. Well, it's just as my great-grandmother told me. - My name's Kiki, and I'm a witch. - Mmm-hmm. Oh, my, what a pretty witch you are. I'm so sorry, but that special treat you were supposed to deliver isn't ready yet. I think there's something wrong with it. It's got a mind of its own, and it doesn't want to heat up. It's old. Like me, it's seen better days. I was hoping you'd be able to deliver a dish to my granddaughter's birthday party. It's my specialty, herring and pumpkin potpie. But I must admit defeat. I'll have to phone her and tell her I'm sorry. I feel just awful having you come here for nothing. Barsa. Barsa. Would you get Kiki's money, please? Certainly, madam. - All of it. Pay her what we agreed on. - Oh, no, I couldn't. Please accept it. This was all my fault. Yes, but... Ma'am, since I don't have any other jobs, maybe I can help. How about we use that old oven  over there? Well, maybe. It used to bake beautiful bread, but I haven't baked in it lately. Well, if it burns firewood, I can help you. I used to help my mom bake all the time. But it's such a big job to build a fire. A great idea, ma'am. I never liked that electric thing. - I think her plan is perfect. - Ma'am, it'll work, really. You think so? All right then. Let's try it. Don't blame me if you're late for your party. I can't take her money and not help out. Let's go. Madam, here. Look what I found. You're a very clever girl, my dear. Your mother must be proud. Oh, well, this is exciting. Mmm-hmm. Yes, this is much better. It should be about time. Yes, the fire's almost ready. Now we wait. You think 40 minutes should be about right? Exactly right. So why don't we take a little break? Maybe I can help around the house while the pie is baking. Oh. How nice of you to offer. - What a wonderful witch. - There we go. You're never gonna make the party on time. Stop worrying- It'll only take me 15 minutes if I fly there fast. Would you like some hot tea? It's no trouble. Dear! What did you say to me was the time of your party? It's at 6:00, but it's only 15 minutes away. Oh, my goodness. I'm afraid my clock runs about 10 minutes slow. - I'm gonna be late. - Check the potpie and see if it's ready. Help. Barsa, come. Quickly! We have to hurry. Kiki is running very late. - Is the pie baked? Is it ready? - It seems fine. Now you'd better hurry. Uh-huh. - We're ready. Come on. - Okay. Let me pay you for your time. - But that's much too much. - Not for all of your help. Hurry up. Hurry up. - Have a good time now. - Here you go. - Bye-bye. - Fly carefully. We can beat the rain if we just fly a little faster.  Not according to my whiskers. Could we get out of the rain, please? I'm begging you. We can't. That'll make us even later, and the food will get cold if we stop. Yes? What do you want? - I have a delivery. - But it is soaking wet. Oh. Well, I'm sorry. It began to rain on the way. But don't worry. The food came through all right. Oh, no. I told Grandma I didn't want that. Hey, what'd you get? Oh, Grandma sent me another one of her crummy herring pies again. Mmm, yummy. Herring pie. Uh, will you please sign this receipt for me? I hate Grandma's stupid pies. I cannot believe they're related. Maybe we still have time. Kiki, there he is. Come on. We can catch him. Kiki, we were all so worried about you. And that poor boy waited such a long time. It doesn't matter anyway. I can't go in these wet clothes. Kiki, what's wrong? Are you not feeling well? Maybe we should eat something, okay? Wake up, Kiki. Hmm? Not feeling very well, huh? - You have quite a fever. - My head's hurting so much. Well, you flew in that weather and you never really dried off. - Do you think I'm going to die, Osono? - Huh? No, you're not. I'll bring some medicine right up, and maybe you should have some potpie. Not that. Well, then, I'll just make something else for you. How about some nice hot oatmeal with honey in it? You want some, too? This oatmeal will pick you right up. There you go. Here. Now, don't burn your tongue. You should come and eat your meal while it's still warm. - Here it is. - Do I have to eat it? Only if you want to get well. Oh! You know that boy stopped by to see you again today. That's right. When I told him you were sick, he asked me how a witch could catch cold in the first place. Oh. And he said he wanted  to visit you a little later. Oh, my gosh. No. Well, I thought you might feel that way, so I turned him down politely. You must be tired. You try to get some sleep. Now, I'll just open up the window so you'll have some fresh air. - Osono? - Hmm? Um... Never mind. Breakfast. Jiji. What? Mmm. Hmm... - Where are you? - Kiki? - Are you feeling better? - A lot better. Thank you. I'm sorry, I didn't realize I'd overslept. That's okay. Come down later. I have a favor to ask you. - All right? - Okay. - The name is "Koppori"? - Uh-huh. Now, take this money. Oh, no, ma'am. No money. It's on me. Impossible. Work is work, and make sure you deliver it in person. Jiji. - What is it? - We've got a delivery. - Hey. Who's your friend there? - Lily's her name. Be right there. Stay there. I'll be right back. He's all yours. Bye-bye. It's so pretty and warm. Hey. Hey, there, Miss Witch. Taking a walk? Uh-uh. I'm looking for someone named Koppori. Hey, that's my name. That's me. If you go around that way, I'll be right with you, okay? Okay. Osono, how could you do this to me? Hi. Gee, thanks a lot. About the other night. I'm sorry I didn't show up. Huh? Mmm-mmm. I'm sorry you had to end up so sick like that. Hey, come over to my place. There's something I wanna show you. Oh, you gotta see it. The party was to celebrate the completion of this thing. What do you think? This is the engine of a man-propelled plane. Watch this. We're going to assemble the wings and the frame at somebody else's house. I'm planning on flying this thing during most of my summer vacation. Miss Witch, I got a great idea. Why don't we go down to the beach where that dirigible landed yesterday? - Dirigible? - Don't tell me you didn't hear about it?  - I was sick. - Then we gotta see it. Let's do it. - We're going on this? - Why not? I have to practice all the time anyway. Gotta build up my legs. Okay. Ready? Um... - This is my first time on a bike. - Oh, boy. Just hold on. Brace the bike with your foot until I get her revved up. Let's go. Okay. Kick off. Now! Good! - Should I get off? - No. Hey, look at that. Whoa. Bye! Lean your body to the inside when we go around the curve. Why? Because otherwise we're gonna have trouble turning. Now. Great. You're doing fine. Now, put your weight into it again. That's it! We're quite a team. All right. We're doing great. Wow. - That's the dirigible, right? - Right. We're flying. Oh, my God! Uh, boy! What happened, Tombo? Are you okay? - Yeah. Are you? - I'm okay. What are you laughing at? - Hmm? - Your face. Do I really look that funny? I'm sorry, but when we flew up, I was so scared. Yeah, me, too. Was it your magic that made us stay up? I'm not sure. Anything's possible. Your bike's a real mess. My propeller. I have to go get it, Kiki. Will you keep an eye on my bike for me? - Uh-huh. What went wrong? - I think I pedaled too hard. That's why it busted. You wait here. I'll be right back. How great would it be to go around the world in a dirigible like that? Of course, you were flying since you were very young, huh? Well, yes. Since I was a baby. My mother used to take me with her. She taught me never to be scared. Gosh. You're so lucky, Kiki. I wish I could fly. People like you can just fly away on a broomstick. But me? That's all I can do. Flying used to be fun until I started doing it for a living. Hey, wait. You can't not enjoy flying. You're a witch. I know. I still feel that way though. But I'm very glad I came with you today.  I feel much better sitting by the beach. Why don't I bring you here whenever you want and train myself at the same time? - You're a very nice person. - Huh? You just found that out? Sorry. But at first I thought you were such a clown. You know, my mom says the same thing. "Don't be such a clown. "Quit looking up at the sky, and get back to your books." - Look at him. - Tombo! - Hey, Tombo! - Huh? - Guess what's up, Tombo? - What? Something really great. You're gonna love it. Come on over. I'll be back in a sec, okay? We're all gonna get to go for a ride in the blimp. Really? Wow! That's great. Hey, who's your friend? That's Kiki. I'll get her to come over. Hey, come over and meet the gang, Kiki. We're all going for a tour inside the Spirit of Freedom. - Thanks, but I don't want to. - Oh. Why not? It'll be fun. She made a delivery to my house on my birthday. - You mean, she's working, at her age? - Well, I'll be. Come on. I'll introduce you to everybody. - No thanks. See you later. - What's the matter? Hey! What are you so mad about? I'm not mad at all, Tombo. I have a lot on my mind. So, please, just leave me alone. Huh? Forget her, Tombo. Come on. And don't forget that this summer, the hit music... Jiji, I think something's wrong with me. I meet a lot of people, and at first everything seems to be going okay, but then I start feeling like such an outsider. You should have seen how Tombo's friends looked at me. Hey, where are you going? Oh. Some friend you are. Kiki's Delivery Service Hey! You know, you can't be late for every meal just because you have a new girlfriend. And you can wash your plate yourself. Why are you talking like a cat? Huh? Oh, my. Oh, no. Talk to me, Jiji.  You mean you can't speak anymore? Jiji? What's going on with him? I can't understand anything he's trying to say. What if it means... Oh, my goodness. I'm losing my witch's powers. What do you mean? You haven't lost your magic, have you? It's become very weak, so I... Well, I think I've got to take a break from my delivery work. But I promise I'll be really good with my work in the bakery, so please let me stay in the room upstairs. Well, that's no problem. I'll bet your powers come back after you've had some rest. I really don't know. Maybe if I make a new broom. Hey. Look at that. Hi, Kiki. It's me, Tombo. Did you see me today? I was waving at you from the dirigible, 'cause the captain let me come into the control cabin during the test run. Boy, did I have a cool time. - Hello? Kiki? Are you there? - Please don't call me anymore. What did you say? I can barely hear you. You know what the captain said... What? Kiki? She hung up. What's the matter, dear? Is there anything I can do for you? I'm still in training to become a witch. If I lose my magic, that means I've lost absolutely everything. Kiki. Uh-huh. It's right over there across the street. Kiki? Kiki? Hey! - Hi. - Hi. Well, since you didn't come and visit me, - I thought I'd come here and visit you. - I'm sorry. Well, that's sort of a white lie. I need to do some shopping, too. Come on in, 'cause I'm done now, and I can take a break, okay? You better believe I will. Nice place you have. Help yourself to some of these, and I'll go make us some tea. No tea, thanks, but some milk if you have any. Sure. Hey, there. Unbelievable. You're the spitting image of that stuffed cat. I bet your name's Jiji, right? Coming through. So, how's the delivery biz?  You making any money? - That bad, huh? - I'm not working much now. Mmm-hmm. Hmm. I kind of thought you looked unhappy. I didn't know things like that happened to witches. Hey! Why don't you come and stay at my cabin? Huh? It'll probably make you feel better. Your boss would let you have a break. How about it, kitty-cat? Wanna come? Hmm? Rather be with your girlfriend, huh? Come on, girl. Why not? We'll leave now. Uh-huh. Come on. Hurry. Hurry. The bus is leaving. Okay, now I'm officially exhausted. It's beautiful here. What's the matter with you? Must've been blinded by two beautiful girls in front of him. Hey! Huh? You really thought I was a boy? Well, it's the way you're dressed and all. Tell me. What kind of a boy has these legs, mister? - You get along with the crows. - Yup. We've become real close friends. - Wow! - Hello, everybody. I'm home again. Good afternoon. I wanna say I'm sorry. Why don't you go inside, and I'll go get some water? Okay. - Like it? - Yes. I have to say I became inspired after the first time we met. But I really haven't got the face right. I've been waiting for you to come back so I can try again. - You mean that's me? - Sure is. You'd make my life easier if you'd model for me. But I'm not very beautiful. What do you want me to do that for? Come on, Kiki. You have got a great face. You're very pretty. Now, don't you be nervous. Sit down over here. Raise your chin up a little. Look straight ahead. Now, don't move. Painting and magical powers seem very much the same. Sometimes I'm unable to paint a thing. You mean it? Then what? What happens? Kiki, please, don't move. It's hard to draw a moving target. Without even thinking about it, I used to be able to fly. Now I'm trying to look inside myself  to find out how I did it. But I just can't figure it out. You know, it could be you're working at it too hard. Maybe you should just take a break. Yeah, but still, if I can't fly... Then stop trying. Take long walks. Look at the scenery. Doze off at noon. Don't even think about flying. And then, pretty soon, you'll be flying again. - You think my problems will... - Go away? That's right. It's gonna be fine. I promise. When I was your age, I'd already decided to become an artist. I loved to paint so much. I'd paint all day until I fell asleep right at my easel. And then one day, for some reason, I just couldn't paint anymore. I tried and tried, but nothing I did seemed any good. They were copies of paintings I'd seen somewhere before, and not very good copies, either. I just felt like I'd lost my ability. That sounds like me. It's exactly the same, but then I found the answer. You see, I hadn't figured out what or why I wanted to paint. I had to discover my own style. When you fly, you rely on what's inside of you, don't you? Uh-huh. We fly with our spirit. Trusting your spirit. Yes, yes! That's exactly what I'm talking about. That same spirit is what makes me paint and makes your friend bake. But we each need to find our own inspiration, Kiki. Sometimes it's not easy. I guess I never gave much thought to why I wanted to do this. I got so caught up in all the training and stuff. Maybe I have to find my own inspiration. But am I ever going to find it? And is it worth all the trouble? Well, for example, there were quite a few times when I thought of painting something over that painting. But it ended up being so great. So I guess it's worth it. Today when I saw you, I thought, "I wanna paint."  - You've got such a great face. - That's why I came? Hey, well, it's better than you cleaning my floor again. - Let's turn out the lights and go to sleep. - Okay. Sorry about taking your bed from you. Ah, no problem. - So you really think I'll fly again? - Sure. You'll just have to wait for the right inspiration to come along. - You understand? - Uh-huh. And there it is, folks, the Spirit of Freedom. Recently downed in a spectacular forced landing... due to torrential rains just outside the city limits. Well, it's been repaired, and is now in final preparation... Yes? Good Cooking Pan Bakery. Kiki. How are you? Well, you take plenty of time coming home. Oh, and by the way, that older woman you made a delivery for? - Uh-huh. - She has another delivery for you. I said I wasn't sure you could do it. She was really very insistent. What do you think, Kiki? Great. Stop there on your way back. Bye. Thank you so much for everything. - Afternoon, ma'am. - Well, well, we've been expecting you. Thanks. There are less than five minutes to takeoff now. Um. It's very nice to see you again, ma'am. I'm glad you came. Please excuse me for not standing. My legs are bothering me more than usual. - Barsa, bring the package now. - Gosh, I hope it hasn't taken off. Not yet. Barsa is absolutely mad about lighter-than-air travel. - I'm the adventuresome type. - Mmm-hmm. Could you turn it down, please? Would you do me a favor and open the box? Yup. I don't get it. Would you please bring this to a young delivery girl? She was kind to me and a very big help. It's my way of saying thank you. Ah, yes, and can you find out when her next birthday is? Then I can bake her another one. Kiki? Of course, I will. And maybe the young  girl will want to know the lady's birthday, because she'll be able to give her a present to repay her. You've got a deal. - What happened? - Oh, there's been a terrible accident. Oh, darn this old thing. And just when it was getting good. Midsummer is always when these winds come. They'll be hitting us any minute. Goodness. It's a strong one. It'll pass quickly. Don't worry. Oh, goody! It's back on. Look. Oh, look at that. It's completely upside down. Freak winds blowing in from the sea. - It has broken loose from... - My, my. How terrible. A desperate last-ditch effort is being made to tie the dirigible to the ground and keep it from drifting into the air. But it's extremely doubtful whether or not this can actually be done. Oh, no, no. It's useless. The tremendous lifting power of the helium balloon is lifting the police patrol car... That's Tombo. That's my friend hanging on that rope. It's being lifted like a toy. Oh, no, there's a young boy hanging onto the cable. He's being lifted away together with the police car. I don't believe what I'm seeing. The dirigible is being blown towards town. - Are you sure it's your friend, my dear? - I have to go. - Be careful. - Oh, dear. Oh! Oh! - Come on. Over here. - Over here. Hold on there, son. Just hold your grip steady. Release the helium from the tail. Quick! All citizens are kindly requested to remain calm. Sir, is there any word about the boy? All I know is that the radio said that the police car dropped into a pool. He's still up there. Stay out of the street. Get on the sidewalks. You there. Young lady. Don't block the street. Do not block the street. Are you all right, young lady? Please, sir, may I use your broom for a minute? - What? - Please. I promise I'll bring it right back.  Huh? I'm not gonna give you my broom... - Thank you very much. - Hey! Fly. Watch out! Come on, broom, fly for me. Ladies and gentlemen, it appears that the blimp is heading directly for the clock tower. And look! The young boy is safe, but he's clutching that rope for dear life. If the wind doesn't shift, the Spirit of Freedom will smash into the tower! We gotta get up higher or else we'll hit the tower, Captain. There's not enough helium. Jump onto the tower before we hit. Aye, aye, Captain. Hey, there. Over here. Come on. Get outta the way. The blimp's gonna crash! Grab a hold of this. Go! Hurry up! Hey! We are listening to the sound of a helium gas leak. The condition of the boy is unknown, but from where I'm standing... It's falling. Too much gas has escaped. It's coming down! It's snagged on the building across the street... Hey, look. Over there. It's a miracle. The young boy has somehow managed to keep his hold on the rope. But how can anyone rescue him now? That brave young boy is hanging on for dear life. He can't... Something just flew by. It's a bird? No, it's not a bird. It's a young girl. No. It's a young witch soaring through the sky, and she's riding... - Go, Kiki. - Oh, my. She can fly again. Get him, Kiki. - Tombo. - Kiki. Tombo. Come on. Be a good broom. Hold on, Tombo. Hang in there, my good lad. - Kiki. - Tombo. And she's trying to reach the boy! - You can do it. Yes. - Don't give up now, sonny. Come on! Don't give up. Don't give up. Don't give up. Don't give up. Don't give up. She got him. She saved the boy. I've never seen anything so amazing. Congratulations, young lady. Now, she's bringing him down to land, safe and sound. She actually caught the boy in midair.  You saw it all live as she saved his life. That broom she used was mine. That was my broom, you know. Oh, Barsa. Oh, my. Kiki was so brave. She really saved the day. Better call the hospital, honey. I think it's time now. Jiji. Hey! Listen, we just got a letter from Kiki. Huh? "Dear Mother and Father, How are you doing? "I'm happy to say that Jiji and I are doing fine at the moment." My delivery service is a big success. I've really started to gain some confidence and everything is falling into place. There are still some times when I feel a little homesick, but all in all, I sure love this city.
